        "## Interpreting the Results {#sec-results}\n",
        "\n",
        "In a Completely Randomised Design (CRD), the analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to test whether there are significant differences among the treatment means. The test statistic, F, follows an F distribution with two sets of degrees of freedom: the numerator degrees of freedom (k‚àí1), where k is the number of treatments, and the denominator degrees of freedom (N‚àík), where N is the total number of experimental units. To determine if the null hypothesis - that all treatment means are equal - can be rejected, the calculated F value from the ANOVA table is compared to the critical F value obtained from an F distribution table based on the degrees of freedom and the chosen significance level (Œ±). If the computed F value exceeds the critical value, the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating that at least one treatment mean differs significantly from the others. However, ANOVA alone does not indicate which specific treatments differ. Therefore, if a significant difference is detected, multiple comparison tests such as Tukey‚Äôs HSD, Bonferroni, or Fisher‚Äôs LSD are performed to make pairwise comparisons between treatments and identify precisely where the differences exist.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Post-hoc test {#sec-posthoctest}\n",
        "\n",
        "When the ANOVA in a **Completely Randomised Design (CRD)** is significant, the following post hoc tests are commonly used for pairwise comparisons: Tukey‚Äôs Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test, and Fisher‚Äôs Least Significant Difference (LSD) test. These tests help identify which specific treatment means differ from each other, addressing the limitation of ANOVA in not indicating the exact sources of variation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Tukey's Test**\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's explore **Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD)** test as it applies to Completely Randomized Design (CRD). After conducting an ANOVA on your CRD experiment, which tells you if there is any significant difference among group means overall, Tukey's HSD test helps you find out exactly which pairs of treatment means differ significantly.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main idea is that Tukey's HSD compares all possible pairs of treatment means while controlling the overall Type I error rate, so you avoid false positives when making multiple comparisons. It calculates a critical value based on the number of treatments, degrees of freedom for error (from ANOVA), and the mean square error.\n",
        "\n",
        "In CRD, this method works well because treatments are assigned completely at random and the error variance is assumed homogeneous. Tukey's HSD uses the within-group variance from ANOVA (Mean Square Error) and the number of replicates per treatment to assess whether the difference between any two means is \"honestly significant.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Before explaining the formula and steps, could you share how comfortable you are with ANOVA in CRD and post-hoc tests like Tukey's HSD? This helps me tailor the explanation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**LSD (Least Significant Difference) Test**\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Least Significant Difference (LSD)** test is a post-hoc statistical procedure used in the context of a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) to identify which specific treatment means differ significantly after a one-way ANOVA has indicated an overall significant effect. When the ANOVA F-test rejects the null hypothesis, it implies that at least one treatment mean is different, but it does not specify which pairs differ. The LSD test addresses this by performing pairwise comparisons between treatment means using a critical difference threshold.\n",
        "\n",
        "The LSD is calculated as $$\n",
        "\\text{LSD} = t_{\\alpha/2, \\, df_{\\text{error}}} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\cdot \\text{MSE}}{n}}\n",
        "$$ where, t\\_{\\alpha/2, , df\\_{\\text{error}}} is the critical t-value at the chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), MSE is the mean square error from the ANOVA, and n is the number of replications per treatment under equal sample sizes. Any absolute difference between two treatment means exceeding this LSD value is declared statistically significant. The test assumes homogeneity of variances and is most valid when the overall F-test is significant, as it uses a pooled error term from all treatments, making it more powerful but also more prone to Type I errors when multiple comparisons are made without adjustment. Therefore, while the LSD test is simple and sensitive, it should be applied cautiously, preferably for pre-planned comparisons or adjacent means in ordered arrays, to avoid inflated error rates due to data snooping.\n",
