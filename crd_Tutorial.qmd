In the **1920s**, statistician [<strong>Ronald A. Fisher</strong>]{data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-trigger="hover" data-bs-html="true" data-bs-placement="right" data-bs-content="<img src='fisher.jpg' width='200' alt='Ronald A. Fisher' style='border-radius:8px; box-shadow:0 0 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);'>"} made significant contributions to the development of the **Completely Randomized Design (CRD)**, which was first used in the early 20th century. Fisher developed this design to enhance agricultural studies, particularly to identify subtle yet significant variations in crop yields under various fertilizer treatments. His novel approach was to **prevent bias** and enable reliable **statistical analysis** through analysis of variance **(ANOVA)** by randomly assigning treatments to experimental units (like land plots). In order to prevent bias and enable reliable statistical analysis using analysis of variance (ANOVA), he invented the practice of randomly allocating treatments to experimental units.

In this design,**experimental units** are randomly assigned to **treatments** without any systematic bias, ensuring that every unit has an equal probability of receiving any given treatment. This random assignment helps counter potential biases and addresses the inherent variability among experimental units, making comparisons between treatments impartial. In order to account for **natural variation** in soil and environment, the first famous instances involved agricultural field trials in which adjacent plots were randomly assigned to different crop kinds or fertilizer treatments. **Agricultural field trials** were the first well-known instances, in which adjacent plots were randomly assigned to different crop varieties or fertilizer treatments to account for inherent soil and environmental variance.

Although **CRD** is generally not advised for heterogeneous settings, it is especially appropriate when the experimental material is **homogeneous**, as in laboratory or greenhouse investigations. Due to its ease of use and efficiency, CRD has established itself as a key instrument in experimental statistics and is still essential in domains including industrial engineering, quality control analysis, medicine, and agriculture.

## Example

Let‚Äôs explore some practical situations in agricultural research where the Completely Randomised Design, also known as the CRD, is applied.

### Study Context {#sec-excrd}

<p>

1.  Ten mango cultivars, each representing a different treatment, are being evaluated by a horticultural scientist. Alphonso, Kesar, Dasheri, Himsagar, Chausa, Badami, Safeda, Bombay, Langra, and Totapuri are among the kinds that are included. The experiment is laid out in three blocks to account for variability among experimental units, such as differences in soil fertility or microclimatic conditions. Each block contains all ten varieties, and the assignment of treatments within each block is randomized. Each response variable (yield, Obs1, Obs2, FW) can be analyzed using a Randomized Block Design (RBD) to determine whether the mango varieties differ significantly while controlling for block effects.<a href="#example1" class="toggle-image" data-target="example-image1">Example1</a>

</p>

::: {#example-image1 style="display: none;"}
<img src="mangodata.webp" alt="Completely Randomised Design Example1" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
:::

<p>

2.  The impact of four chemical treatments (C1 through C4) on a response variable that is measured over time is being assessed by a chemist. There are four replications of each treatment, for a total of 16 observations per time point. On Day 1, Day 3, Day 6, Day 7, and Day 15, observations were made. There are four replications for every treatment since each treatment is repeated four times. An Arcsine transformation can be tested using the proportion data in the final column. To ascertain whether the four chemical treatments differ significantly from one another, a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) can be employed to examine each response variable or time point independently.<a href="#example2" class="toggle-image" data-target="example-image2">Example2</a>

</p>

::: {#example-image2 style="display: none;"}

<p>

3.  An engineer is evaluating three different shapes of an instrument (Wedge, Sphere, and Square) to study their effect at different depths. Each shape is tested 10 times, giving a total of 30 observations. Observations were recorded at 4 depths: 1mm, 2mm, 3mm, and 4mm. Since each shape is replicated 10 times, there are 10 replications per shape. A Completely Randomised Design (CRD) can be used to analyze each depth separately to determine whether there are significant differences among the three shapes of the instrument. <a href="#example3" class="toggle-image" data-target="example-image3">Example3</a>

### Assumptions

In order to guarantee the **validity** and **dependability** of experimental outcomes, CRD (Completely Randomized Design) is predicated on a number of essential assumptions. Maintaining these fundamental parameters throughout the experiment is **crucial** for the integrity of statistical analysis, particularly when employing **ANOVA**.

-   **Independence** : In experimental design the **outcome** (response) of one experimental unit is not affected by or connected to the outcome of another unit.

-   **Random Assignment** : In experimental design, **randomization** is the process of allocating treatments to experimental units at random, ensuring that each unit has an equal chance of receiving any given treatment.

-   **Homogeneity of Variance** : Also referred to as **homoscedasticity**, the variance of mistakes should be the same for every group or treatment.

-   **Normality** : Each treatment's residuals or errors should have a **normal distribution**. For ANOVA results to be valid, this is necessary.

-   **Additivity** : There is no interaction between unaccounted for factors; the effects in the model are **additive**. This indicates that the overall mean, treatment effect, and random error add up to the observed result.

### Hypotheses

The Completely Randomised Design evaluates the following hypotheses:

::: {.callout-note title="Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)"}
All treatment means are equal, indicating that the treatments have no significant effect on the response variable $$H_0 : \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \cdots = \mu_t$$
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)"}
At least one treatment mean ($\mu_i$) is significantly different from the others, suggesting that treatments have an effect on the response variable.

$$H_1 : \text{At least one } \mu_i \text{ differs}$$
:::

<details>

<summary>Steps in Completely Randomised Design</summary>

-   Step one: Assign Treatments Randomly

-   Step two: Collect and Organize Results

-   Step three: Summarize Data Within Each Group

-   Step four: Conduct ANOVA and Calculate F Statistic

-   Step five: Obtain and Interpret the P-value

-   Step six: Post-hoc Comparisons

### The Test Statistic

The Completely Randomised Design test statistic is calculated using the @eq-crd.

::: {.callout-tip title="Use this for Completely Randomised Design"}
$$
F = \frac{\text{Mean Square due to Treatments (MST)}}{\text{Mean Square due to Error (MSE)}}
$$ {#eq-crd}
:::

This statistic is used to determine whether there are significant differences among the treatment means.

### Correction for Ties

If the assumptions of ANOVA are slightly violated, or if there are unequal sample sizes (missing values) in the dataset, the F-statistic can be adjusted using **Aitken's adjustment** or a **corrected mean square** approach:

::: {.callout-tip title="Use this for Completely Randomised Design"}
Adjustment for Unequal Variances or Missing Values $$
F_{adjusted} = \frac{\text{Corrected Mean Square Between Treatments}}{\text{Corrected Mean Square Error}}
$$
:::

This ensures that the test remains valid under minor violations of CRD assumptions.

### CRD Linear Model

The mathematical form of the **Completely Randomised Design (CRD)** is very important because it gives a precise, structured way to describe and analyze the experiment statistically. This helps us understand that what we observe is not just random - it‚Äôs a combination of systematic treatment differences and random variation.

The **CRD linear model** allows us to partition the total variation in the data into:

 - Variation due to treatments

 - Variation due to random error
 
**The model assumes**: Errors are independent, normally distributed, and have equal variance. These assumptions make it possible to apply valid statistical tests, confidence intervals, and predictive models.

### Interpreting the Results

In a Completely Randomised Design (CRD), the analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to test whether there are significant differences among the treatment means. The test statistic, F, follows an F distribution with two sets of degrees of freedom: the numerator degrees of freedom (k-1), where k is the number of treatments, and the denominator degrees of freedom (N-k), where N is the total number of experimental units. To determine if the null hypothesis - that all treatment means are equal - can be rejected, the calculated F value from the ANOVA table is compared to the critical F value obtained from an F distribution table based on the degrees of freedom and the chosen significance level (Œ±).

If the computed F value exceeds the critical value, the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating that at least one treatment mean differs significantly from the others. However, ANOVA alone does not indicate which specific treatments differ. Therefore, if a significant difference is detected, multiple comparison tests such as Fisher‚Äôs LSD, Tukey‚Äôs HSD or DMRT are performed to make pairwise comparisons between treatments and identify precisely where the differences exist.

<details>

<summary>What is a post-hoc test?</summary>

A post-hoc test is a follow-up analysis performed after finding a significant result in an overall statistical test (like ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis). Its purpose is to identify exactly which groups or treatments differ from each other. In other words, it helps pinpoint where the differences lie between multiple groups when the initial test shows that not all groups are the same.

### Post-hoc test {#sec-post}

<details>

<summary>Which post-hoc test to use?</summary>

When choosing a post-hoc test after performing a Completely Randomised Design, the decision largely depends on the characteristics of your data and the goals of your analysis.--------------------------------------------------

</details>

## Post-hoc test {#sec-posthoctest}

When the ANOVA in a **Completely Randomised Design (CRD)** is significant, the following post hoc tests are commonly used for pairwise comparisons: Tukey‚Äôs Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test, and Fisher‚Äôs Least Significant Difference (LSD) test. These tests help identify which specific treatment means differ from each other, addressing the limitation of ANOVA in not indicating the exact sources of variation.

**Tukey's Test**

Let's explore **Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD)** test as it applies to Completely Randomized Design (CRD). After conducting an ANOVA on your CRD experiment, which tells you if there is any significant difference among group means overall, Tukey's HSD test helps you find out exactly which pairs of treatment means differ significantly.

The main idea is that Tukey's HSD compares all possible pairs of treatment means while controlling the overall Type I error rate, so you avoid false positives when making multiple comparisons. It calculates a critical value based on the number of treatments, degrees of freedom for error (from ANOVA), and the mean square error.

In CRD, this method works well because treatments are assigned completely at random and the error variance is assumed homogeneous. Tukey's HSD uses the within-group variance from ANOVA (Mean Square Error) and the number of replicates per treatment to assess whether the difference between any two means is "honestly significant."

**LSD (Least Significant Difference) Test**

The **Least Significant Difference (LSD)** test is a post-hoc statistical procedure used in the context of a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) to identify which specific treatment means differ significantly after a one-way ANOVA has indicated an overall significant effect. When the ANOVA F-test rejects the null hypothesis, it implies that at least one treatment mean is different, but it does not specify which pairs differ. The LSD test addresses this by performing pairwise comparisons between treatment means using a critical difference threshold.

The LSD is calculated as $$
\text{LSD} = t_{\alpha/2, \, df_{\text{error}}} \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot \text{MSE}}{n}}
$$
where, t\_{\alpha/2, , df\_{\text{error}}} is the critical t-value at the chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), MSE is the mean square error from the ANOVA, and n is the number of replications per treatment under equal sample sizes. Any absolute difference between two treatment means exceeding this LSD value is declared statistically significant. The test assumes homogeneity of variances and is most valid when the overall F-test is significant, as it uses a pooled error term from all treatments, making it more powerful but also more prone to Type I errors when multiple comparisons are made without adjustment. Therefore, while the LSD test is simple and sensitive, it should be applied cautiously, preferably for pre-planned comparisons or adjacent means in ordered arrays, to avoid inflated error rates due to data snooping.

### A working example

We‚Äôll guide you through the entire Completely Randomised Design step by step. To begin, let‚Äôs look at how the analysis can be carried out using Example 1 described in @sec-excrd. For clarity, here‚Äôs a quick recap of the example: Ten mango cultivars each representing a different treatment, are being evaluated by a horticultural scientist. Alphonso, Kesar, Dasheri, Himsagar, Chausa, Badami, Safeda, Bombay, Langra, and Totapuri are among the kinds that are included. Thirty observations are obtained by replicating each variety three times.

The dataset format required for analysis in RAISINS is illustrated in @fig-data.

Preparing data in RAISINS is simple and straightforward. Detailed instructions are provided in @sec-createData. Additionally, model datasets are available within the app for testing purposes, as explained in @sec-Datasets. See how dataset is arranged for analysis @fig-data.

RAISINS generates result table in the format given in @fig-res1 and @fig-result2 after the analysis.

![Result table in RAISINS](res1.webp){#fig-res1 fig-align="center" width="703"}

From the above result table @fig-res1 significant varietal differences were observed for yield and Obs1 traits, indicating that the performance of mango varieties differed significantly for these parameters. Obs2 and FW showed non-significant differences, meaning performance was relatively uniform across varieties for these traits.

![Result table](Result2.webp){#fig-result2}

<summary>Overview of ANOVA Results and Interpretation</summary>

1.  *Treatments and Response Variables*

**Treatments**: The rows list ten mango varieties: Alphonso, Badami, Bombay_g, Chausa, Dasheri, Himsagar, Kesar, Langra, Safeda, and Totapuri.

**Yield, Obs1, Obs2, FW**: Each variety‚Äôs performance is shown for these response variables. Cell values are reported as mean ¬± standard deviation.

2.  *Multiple Comparisons*

Superscript letters (e.g., "a", "b", "c") indicate groupings from a post-hoc test. Means with the same letter are not significantly different. For example, Alphonso ("a") has significantly higher yield than Himsagar ("bcd"), but not different from Totapuri ("ab").

3.  *ANOVA Summary*

**F stat**: F-statistic for each variable indicates if significant differences exist among varieties. For yield and Obs1, F is significant (p ‚â§ 0.05), while for Obs2 and FW, F is not significant (p \> 0.05).

**p value**: Indicates the significance of the F-statistic. Yield (0.01) and Obs1 (0.02) are statistically significant, Obs2 (0.12) and FW (0.35) are not.

4.  *Critical Difference (CD) and Error Estimates*

**CD**: The minimum difference between means required for significance. E.g., for yield, group differences exceeding 175.62 are significant.

**MSE, SE(m), SE(d), CV(%)**: Various error estimates and coefficients of variation - a lower CV% reflects less variability relative to the mean.

**Cohen‚Äôs F**: Effect size; higher values suggest greater variance explained by treatment differences.

</details>

From the above result table @fig-result2, Alphonso and Dasheri recorded higher yields, suggesting they may be better-performing varieties under the given conditions. The lower MSE for Obs1 indicates that the replicates of that variable are more consistent. SE(m) for yield = 59.53, shows moderate precision in yield mean estimation. SE(d) = 84.19, indicates the uncertainty when comparing two treatment means. The low to moderate CV values indicate that the experiment was conducted with reasonable accuracy and reliability.

After a significant result in the Completely Randomised Design, a post-hoc comparison is automatically performed to identify which treatment groups differ significantly for each response variable under study. LSD(Least significant difference test)  will be performed by default, you can change the post-hoc test to TUKEY and DMRT (Duncan‚Äôs Multiple Range Test) by changing from the drop down menu. The results of the post-hoc test are summarized using letter groupings. Treatments that share the same letter are considered on par, meaning their mean are not significantly different.

For example, in the case of the response variables *Obs2* and *FW* no letter groupings are shown, indicating that the Completely Randomised Design did not find significant differences among the treatments. However, for *yield*, treatments Alphonso and Dasheri are assigned the letter ‚Äòa‚Äô, while Badami and Chausa are assigned the letter ‚Äòabc‚Äô. This indicates that Alphonso and Dasheri form one group with similar yield, while Badami and Chausa form another, significantly different group. Since the mean yields of Alphonso and Dasheri are higher, it suggests that these treatments were rated better in yield.

You can interpret the results for the other response variables in the same way: treatments with the same letter do not differ significantly in their effect on that response variable, while those with different letters do.

From the results @fig-result2, it's found that yield wise, Alphonso and Dasheri are the best, and by Obs1, Dasheri and Himsagar are the best. If your objective is to select treatments based on all response variables, a multivariate analysis has to be performed. For that click on `Multivaraite` tab. The results as mentioned in @sec-multi gives you the best treatment based on all the observed characters.

### Customization tabs

In RAISINS, you can easily customize your analysis by adjusting settings such as decimal places, choice of multiple comparison tests, font style, and significance level. These options help tailor the results to your specific needs, as shown in @fig-custom.

## Multivariate and AI {#sec-multi}

In a Completely Randomised Design (CRD), treatments are assigned randomly to experimental units, ensuring that each unit has an equal chance of receiving any treatment. This design is commonly used to compare the effects of different treatments on a single response variable. Now, in our example, of evaluation of ten mango cultivars - Alphonso, Kesar, Dasheri, Himsagar, Chausa, Badami, Safeda, Bombay, Langra, and Totapuri - by a horticultural scientist navigate to `Multivariate` tab see @fig-mu. Multivariate analysis in Completely Randomised Design (CRD) helps you to compare different response variables simultaneously! Remember the PCA used for multivariate selection, is an exploratory technique, not an inferential method.

![Multivariate tab in RAISINS](MUTITAB.webp){#fig-mu}

A MANOVA and PCA will be automatically carried out based on the selected variables. MANOVA table with interpretation appears automatically. PCA results and plots will appear along with automated interpretation.

![Manova Results](MAN2.webp){#fig-MAN2 fig-align="center"}

The table titled 'Eigen Values PCA' given @fig-PC provides information about the eigenvalues and the percentage of variance explained by each principal component. The principal components PC1, PC2 have eigenvalues greater than one and are considered important for further analysis. PC1 accounts for approximately 41.16% of the variance in the dataset, while PC2 accounts for about 29.5% of the variance. Together, PC1 and PC2 explain approximately 70.66% of the total variance (termed as cumulative variance). Since PC1 explains more than 40% of the variance, a PC1-based index score is a strong consideration. Additionally, since both PCs explain more than 60% of the variance in the data, an index score based on both PCs is also appropriate. The scree plot below illustrates the proportion of variance explained by each principal component.

![PCA-based Index Score](MAN3.webp){#fig-PC}

The scree plot given @fig-screeplot illustrates the proportion of variance explained by each principal component.

![Scree plot](CRD_Scree_Plot2025-10-07.webp){#fig-screeplot fig-align="center"}

Look upon the loadings of each variable in the given @fig-loadings and decide which PC-based index needs to be selected. You can see that the variables yield, Obs2 have positive loadings in PC1. If you are seeking treatments with high values for these variables, consider treatments with a high index score based on PC1. Thus, treatments with high index scores based on PC1 can be considered optimal for improving the above variables. Conversely, the variables Obs1, FW have negative loadings in PC1. If you aim to improve these variables, look for treatments with a low index score based on PC1. For PC2, the variables yield, Obs1, FW have positive loadings. If these variables are your focus, consider an index score based on PC2. Similarly, the variables Obs2 have negative loadings on PC2, and treatments with low index scores for PC2 would be suitable for these variables. It is recommended to use variables that are highly correlated for PCA, as this helps in constructing a more reliable and meaningful index.

![Loadings of each variable](MAN4.webp){#fig-loadings fig-align="center"}

The biplot gives a visual representation of the relationships among variables and treatments. Treatments with high values for a specific variable are positioned in the direction of that variable. The angle between variables in the biplot indicates their correlation, smaller angles suggest high positive correlation, while larger angles close to 90 degrees suggest weak or no correlation. Thus, the biplot aids in understanding the contributions of variables to each PC and in identifying patterns among treatments.

![PCA-Biplot](BiplotPCA2025-10-07.webp){#fig-biplot} 

In RAISINS, we calculate a scaled index score by converting the index score to a range of 0 to 1, making it easier to interpret and compare. This standardized approach ensures consistency in evaluating treatments based on their index scores.To refine your selection, use the 'Select cutoff for Scaled Index Score' feature given as in @fig-indexscore, where you can choose the cutoff percentage to select treatments above or below a certain threshold. The default cutoff is set at 75%. By toggling the up-arrow and down-arrow buttons below the cutoff selection, you can select the top or bottom percentage of treatments as per your preference. Selected treatments are highlighted in yellow in the table below, providing a clear visual cue. Additionally, a plot based on the index scores is also displayed to aid in your analysis.

![Index score](MAN5.webp){#fig-indexscore fig-align="center"}

Combining all this information, the experimenter can arrive at an overall conclusion that is statistically sound and contextually relevant to their study.

RAISINS is equipped with an AI-powered RAISINS Assistant designed to assist users in comprehending the outcomes of statistical tests and data analysis. This functionality provides clear and concise summaries of results, identifies statistically significant differences between groups, and offers informed suggestions for potential next steps or interpretations.

## Preparing your data {#sec-createData}

"Your analysis is only as good as your data! Feed RAISINS high-quality data, and it will deliver powerful insights feed it messy data, and the results won‚Äôt be trustworthy."

1.  Create your dataset in MS Excel

2.  Build your dataset directly within the RAISINS app

## Preparing data in MS Excel {#sec-MSEXCEL}

Open a new blank sheet in MS Excel with only one sheet included, and avoid adding any unnecessary content. The dataset should follow a column-based format, where the first column represents the treatment or group to be compared-you can name this column appropriately, such as ‚ÄúGroup‚Äù or ‚ÄúTreatment.‚Äù All characters under study (e.g., yield, Obs1, Obs2, FW) should be arranged in separate columns, and each group should be repeated according to the number of replications. The file can be saved in CSV, XLS, or XLSX format, but CSV is recommended as it is lighter and enables faster loading. Ensure that there are no unwanted spaces in column names or group names. For reference, see the structure shown in @fig-1. As illustrated in @fig-data, groups must appear repeatedly based on replications, and the data can also be arranged as shown in @fig-2.
