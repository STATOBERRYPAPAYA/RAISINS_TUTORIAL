Random assignment of treatments in CRD design
:::

In this design, **experimental units** are randomly assigned to **treatments** without any systematic bias, ensuring that every unit has an equal probability of receiving any given treatment. This random assignment helps counter potential biases and addresses the inherent variability among experimental units, making comparisons between treatments impartial. In order to account for **natural variation** in soil and environment, the first famous instances involved agricultural field trials in which adjacent plots were randomly assigned to different crop kinds or fertilizer treatments. **Agricultural field trials** were the first well-known instances, in which adjacent plots were randomly assigned to different crop varieties or fertilizer treatments to account for inherent soil and environmental variance.

Although **CRD** is generally not advised for heterogeneous settings, it is especially appropriate when the experimental material is **homogeneous**, as in laboratory or greenhouse investigations. Due to its ease of use and efficiency, CRD has established itself as a key instrument in experimental statistics and is still essential in domains including industrial engineering, quality control analysis, medicine, and agriculture.

# Key Characteristics

• **Random allocation**: Treatments are randomly assigned to experimental units

• **Homogeneous conditions**: Best suited when experimental units are relatively uniform

• **Flexibility**: Number of replications can vary between treatments

• **Simple analysis**: Uses one-way ANOVA for statistical analysis

# When to Use CRD ?

**Appropriate situations**:

• Laboratory experiments with controlled conditions

• Greenhouse experiments with uniform environmental conditions

• Animal feeding trials where animals are relatively homogeneous

• Pot experiments with uniform soil and environmental conditions

# Not recommended when:

• Experimental area shows significant variation (use RCBD instead)

• There's a known gradient in the experimental material

• Field experiments with heterogeneous soil conditions

# Advantages and Disadvantages

## Advantages:

• Simple to design and analyze

• Flexible in number of treatments and replications

• Maximum degrees of freedom for error term

• Missing data doesn't complicate analysis significantly

• Easy to understand and implement

## Disadvantages:

• Requires homogeneous experimental conditions

• Less precise than blocking designs when heterogeneity exists

• Can lead to larger experimental error if conditions are not uniform

## Layout Example

Suppose we're testing 4 fertilizer treatments (A, B, C, D) with 5 replications each (20 experimental units total):

# Statistical Model

The linear model for **CRD** is:

``` r
Yᵢⱼ = μ + τᵢ + εᵢⱼ  
```

**Where**:

• **Yᵢⱼ** = observation for the jth unit receiving the ith treatment

• **μ** = overall mean

• **τᵢ** = effect of the ith treatment

• **εᵢⱼ** = random error (assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 and variance σ²)

• **i** = 1, 2, ..., t (treatments)

• **j** = 1, 2, ..., r (replications)

# Example

Let’s explore some practical situations in agricultural research where the Completely Randomised Design, also known as the CRD, is applied.

## Study Context

1.  Ten mango cultivars (V1 through V10), each representing a different treatment, are being evaluated by a horticultural scientist. Alphonso, Kesar, Dasheri, Himsagar, Chausa, Badami, Safeda, Bombay, Langra, and Totapuri are among the kinds that are included. Thirty observations are obtained by replicating each variety three times. Each response variable (yield, Obs1, Obs2, FW) can be analyzed using a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) to see whether the mango varieties differ significantly from one another.

2.  The impact of four chemical treatments (C1 through C4) on a response variable that is measured over time is being assessed by a chemist. There are four replications of each treatment, for a total of 16 observations per time point. On Day 1, Day 3, Day 6, Day 7, and Day 15, observations were made. There are four replications for every treatment since each treatment is repeated four times. An Arcsine transformation can be tested using the proportion data in the final column. To ascertain whether the four chemical treatments differ significantly from one another, a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) can be employed to examine each response variable or time point independently.

3.  An engineer is evaluating three different shapes of an instrument (Wedge, Sphere, and Square) to study their effect at different depths. Each shape is tested 10 times, giving a total of 30 observations. Observations were recorded at 4 depths: 1mm, 2mm, 3mm, and 4mm. Since each shape is replicated 10 times, there are 10 replications per shape. A Completely Randomised Design (CRD) can be used to analyze each depth separately to determine whether there are significant differences among the three shapes of the instrument.

## Theory

The theory of the Completely Randomized Design can be read below, or if you're a non-statistician who is simply interested in the practical elements, you can go straight to **Section---**, where we've provided a real- world example. The essential procedures for carrying out the Completely Randomized Design are described in the theoretical section. Comprehending these ideas will enable you to do the analysis with assurance and clarity.

## Assumptions

In order to guarantee the **validity** and **dependability** of experimental outcomes, CRD (Completely Randomized Design) is predicated on a number of essential assumptions. Maintaining these fundamental parameters throughout the experiment is **crucial** for the integrity of statistical analysis, particularly when employing **ANOVA**.

**Independence** : Independence in experimental design refers to the fact that the **outcome** (response) of one experimental unit is not affected by or connected to the outcome of another unit. Because it gives us confidence that every unit offers a distinct and unaffected piece of information regarding the process or treatment under study, this is a fundamental premise of the **majority** of statistical tests.

**Random Assignment** : In experimental design, **randomization** is the process of allocating treatments to experimental units at random, ensuring that each unit has an equal chance of receiving any given treatment. This procedure balances **known** and **unknown** factors across groups, removing selection bias and guaranteeing fairness. By doing this, the groups are initially made comparable, and any variations in results can be ascribed to the treatments rather than underlying differences. Random number tables, computer algorithms, and other chance techniques are frequently used for randomization.

**Homogeneity of Variance** : Also referred to as homoscedasticity, the variance of mistakes should be the same for every group or treatment

**Normality** : Each treatment's residuals or errors should have a normal distribution. For ANOVA results to be valid, this is necessary

**Additivity** : There is no interaction between unaccounted for factors; the effects in the model are additive. This indicates that the overall mean, treatment effect, and random error add up to the observed result

We'll walk you through every stage of the **Completely Randomised Design** step by step. Let's start by examining how the analysis can be performed using **Example 1**, which is covered in **Section 2.1.1**. For clarity, here’s a quick recap of the example: Ten mango cultivars (V1 through V10), each representing a different treatment, are being evaluated by a horticultural scientist. Alphonso, Kesar, Dasheri, Himsagar, Chausa, Badami, Safeda, Bombay, Langra, and Totapuri are among the kinds that are included.
