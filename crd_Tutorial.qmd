<!-- In the **1920s**, statistician **Ronald A.

Fisher developed this design to enhance agricultural studies, particularly to identify subtle yet significant variations in crop yields under various fertilizer treatments. His novel approach was to **preventing bias** and enabling reliable **statistical analysis** through analysis of variance **(ANOVA)** was to randomly assign treatments to experimental units (like land plots).

Random assignment of treatments in CRD design
:::

In this design,**experimental units** are randomly assigned to **treatments** without any systematic bias, ensuring that every unit has an equal probability of receiving any given treatment. This random assignment helps counter potential biases and addresses the inherent variability among experimental units, making comparisons between treatments impartial. In order to account for **natural variation** in soil and environment, the first famous instances involved agricultural field trials in which adjacent plots were randomly assigned to different crop kinds or fertilizer treatments. **Agricultural field trials** were the first well-known instances, in which adjacent plots were randomly assigned to different crop varieties or fertilizer treatments to account for inherent soil and environmental variance.

<!-- [Random assignment of treatments in CRD](crd1.png) -->

Although **CRD** is generally not advised for heterogeneous settings, it is especially appropriate when the experimental material is **homogeneous**, as in laboratory or greenhouse investigations. Due to its ease of use and efficiency, CRD has established itself as a key instrument in experimental statistics and is still essential in domains including industrial engineering, quality control analysis, medicine, and agriculture.

# CRD Linear Model

The mathematical form of the **Completely Randomised Design (CRD)** is very important because it gives a precise, structured way to describe and analyze the experiment statistically. This helps us understand that what we observe is not just random - it‚Äôs a combination of systematic treatment differences and random variation.

The **CRD linear model** allows us to partition the total variation in the data into:

 - Variation due to treatments

 - Variation due to random error
 
**The model assumes**: Errors are independent, normally distributed, and have equal variance. These assumptions make it possible to apply valid statistical tests, confidence intervals, and predictive models.

# Example

Let‚Äôs explore some practical situations in agricultural research where the Completely Randomised Design, also known as the CRD, is applied.

## Study Context {#sec-example}

<p>

1.  Ten mango cultivars (V1 through V10), each representing a different treatment, are being evaluated by a horticultural scientist. Alphonso, Kesar, Dasheri, Himsagar, Chausa, Badami, Safeda, Bombay, Langra, and Totapuri are among the kinds that are included. Thirty observations are obtained by replicating each variety three times. Each response variable (yield, Obs1, Obs2, FW) can be analyzed using a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) to see whether the mango varieties differ significantly from one another.<a href="#" id="toggle">Example1</a>\
    <img src="mangodata.webp" id="mango" style="display:none; margin-top:10px; max-width:100%;"/>

```{=html}
<script>
document.getElementById("toggle").onclick = e => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const img = document.getElementById("mango");
  img.style.display = img.style.display === "none" ? "block" : "none";
};
</script>
```
<p>

2.  The impact of four chemical treatments (C1 through C4) on a response variable that is measured over time is being assessed by a chemist. There are four replications of each treatment, for a total of 16 observations per time point. On Day 1, Day 3, Day 6, Day 7, and Day 15, observations were made. There are four replications for every treatment since each treatment is repeated four times. An Arcsine transformation can be tested using the proportion data in the final column. To ascertain whether the four chemical treatments differ significantly from one another, a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) can be employed to examine each response variable or time point independently.<a href="#" onclick="var img=document.getElementById('chem-img'); img.style.display = img.style.display === 'none' ? 'block' : 'none'; return false;">Example2</a>

<img src="CHEMEXAMPLE.webp" id="chem-img" style="display:none; max-width:100%; margin-top:10px;"/>

</p>

3.  An engineer is evaluating three different shapes of an instrument (Wedge, Sphere, and Square) to study their effect at different depths. Each shape is tested 10 times, giving a total of 30 observations. Observations were recorded at 4 depths: 1mm, 2mm, 3mm, and 4mm. Since each shape is replicated 10 times, there are 10 replications per shape. A Completely Randomised Design (CRD) can be used to analyze each depth separately to determine whether there are significant differences among the three shapes of the instrument. <a href="#" onclick="var img=document.getElementById('shape-img'); img.style.display = img.style.display === 'none' ? 'block' : 'none'; return false;">Example3</a> <img src="SHAPEEXAMPLE.webp" id="shape-img" style="display:none; max-width:100%; margin-top:10px;"/>

</p>

## Theory {#sec-theory}

The theory of the Completely Randomized Design can be read below, or if you're a non-statistician who is simply interested in the practical elements, you can go straight to **Section---**, where we've provided a real-world example. The essential procedures for carrying out the Completely Randomized Design are described in the theoretical section. Comprehending these ideas will enable you to do the analysis with assurance and clarity.

## Assumptions {#sec-assumptions}

In order to guarantee the **validity** and **dependability** of experimental outcomes, CRD (Completely Randomized Design) is predicated on a number of essential assumptions. Maintaining these fundamental parameters throughout the experiment is **crucial** for the integrity of statistical analysis, particularly when employing **ANOVA**.

-   **Independence** : In experimental design the **outcome** (response) of one experimental unit is not affected by or connected to the outcome of another unit

-   **Random Assignment** : In experimental design, **randomization** is the process of allocating treatments to experimental units at random, ensuring that each unit has an equal chance of receiving any given treatment

-   **Homogeneity of Variance** : Also referred to as homoscedasticity, the variance of mistakes should be the same for every group or treatment

-   **Normality** : Each treatment's residuals or errors should have a normal distribution. For ANOVA results to be valid, this is necessary

-   **Additivity** : There is no interaction between unaccounted for factors; the effects in the model are additive. This indicates that the overall mean, treatment effect, and random error add up to the observed result

## Hypotheses {#sec-hypotheses}

The Completely Randomized Design (CRD) evaluates the following hypotheses:

::: callout-important
#### Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)

All treatment means are equal, indicating that the treatments have no significant effect on the response variable

$$H_0 : \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \cdots = \mu_t$$
:::

::: callout-important
#### Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)

At least one treatment mean ($\mu_i$) is significantly different from the others, suggesting that treatments have an effect on the response variable.

$$H_1 : \text{At least one } \mu_i \text{ differs}$$
:::

## The Test Statistic {#sec-teststatistic}

::: callout-tip
#### The test statistic for CRD is calculated using the **one-way ANOVA F-statistic**:

$$
F = \frac{\text{Mean Square due to Treatments (MST)}}{\text{Mean Square due to Error (MSE)}}
$$

This statistic is used to determine whether there are significant differences among the treatment means.
:::

## Correction for Ties  {#sec-results}

::: callout-tip
#### Adjustment for Unequal Variances or Missing Values 

If the assumptions of ANOVA are slightly violated, or if there are unequal sample sizes (missing values) in the dataset, the F-statistic can be adjusted using **Aitken's adjustment** or a **corrected mean square** approach:

$$
F_{adjusted} = \frac{\text{Corrected Mean Square Between Treatments}}{\text{Corrected Mean Square Error}}
$$ This ensures that the test remains valid under minor violations of CRD assumptions.
:::

## Interpreting the Results {#sec-results}

In a Completely Randomised Design (CRD), the analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to test whether there are significant differences among the treatment means. The test statistic, F, follows an F distribution with two sets of degrees of freedom: the numerator degrees of freedom (k‚àí1), where k is the number of treatments, and the denominator degrees of freedom (N‚àík), where N is the total number of experimental units. To determine if the null hypothesis - that all treatment means are equal - can be rejected, the calculated F value from the ANOVA table is compared to the critical F value obtained from an F distribution table based on the degrees of freedom and the chosen significance level (Œ±). If the computed F value exceeds the critical value, the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating that at least one treatment mean differs significantly from the others. However, ANOVA alone does not indicate which specific treatments differ. Therefore, if a significant difference is detected, multiple comparison tests such as Tukey‚Äôs HSD, Bonferroni, or Fisher‚Äôs LSD are performed to make pairwise comparisons between treatments and identify precisely where the differences exist.

## Post-hoc test {#sec-posthoctest}

When the ANOVA in a **Completely Randomised Design (CRD)** is significant, the following post hoc tests are commonly used for pairwise comparisons: Tukey‚Äôs Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test, and Fisher‚Äôs Least Significant Difference (LSD) test. These tests help identify which specific treatment means differ from each other, addressing the limitation of ANOVA in not indicating the exact sources of variation.

**Tukey's Test**

Let's explore **Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD)** test as it applies to Completely Randomized Design (CRD). After conducting an ANOVA on your CRD experiment, which tells you if there is any significant difference among group means overall, Tukey's HSD test helps you find out exactly which pairs of treatment means differ significantly.

The main idea is that Tukey's HSD compares all possible pairs of treatment means while controlling the overall Type I error rate, so you avoid false positives when making multiple comparisons. It calculates a critical value based on the number of treatments, degrees of freedom for error (from ANOVA), and the mean square error.

In CRD, this method works well because treatments are assigned completely at random and the error variance is assumed homogeneous. Tukey's HSD uses the within-group variance from ANOVA (Mean Square Error) and the number of replicates per treatment to assess whether the difference between any two means is "honestly significant."

Before explaining the formula and steps, could you share how comfortable you are with ANOVA in CRD and post-hoc tests like Tukey's HSD? This helps me tailor the explanation.

**LSD (Least Significant Difference) Test**

The **Least Significant Difference (LSD)** test is a post-hoc statistical procedure used in the context of a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) to identify which specific treatment means differ significantly after a one-way ANOVA has indicated an overall significant effect. When the ANOVA F-test rejects the null hypothesis, it implies that at least one treatment mean is different, but it does not specify which pairs differ. The LSD test addresses this by performing pairwise comparisons between treatment means using a critical difference threshold.

The LSD is calculated as $$
\text{LSD} = t_{\alpha/2, \, df_{\text{error}}} \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot \text{MSE}}{n}}
$$ where, t\_{\alpha/2, , df\_{\text{error}}} is the critical t-value at the chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), MSE is the mean square error from the ANOVA, and n is the number of replications per treatment under equal sample sizes. Any absolute difference between two treatment means exceeding this LSD value is declared statistically significant. The test assumes homogeneity of variances and is most valid when the overall F-test is significant, as it uses a pooled error term from all treatments, making it more powerful but also more prone to Type I errors when multiple comparisons are made without adjustment. Therefore, while the LSD test is simple and sensitive, it should be applied cautiously, preferably for pre-planned comparisons or adjacent means in ordered arrays, to avoid inflated error rates due to data snooping.

## Multivariate and AI {#sec-multivariateAI}

The **Completely Randomised Design (CRD)** is generally used to compare the effects of different treatments on a single response variable. However, when multiple traits are measured for the same set of treatments (for example: Yield, Plant Height, Leaf Area, Root Weight, and Quality), you can explore them together using the Multivariate tab (see Figure -----).Multivariate analysis in CRD helps you examine how treatments perform across several traits simultaneously-offering a broader view of treatment performance. Remember, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) used here is an exploratory tool, helping you visualize relationships among traits and treatments, but it is not an inferential statistical test. ![Multivariate tab in RAISINS](MULTITAB.webp){fig-align="center"} To perform MANOVA and PCA please note that the number of treatments must be greater than the number of variables. A MANOVA and PCA will be automatically carried out based on the selected variables. MANOVA table with interpretation appears automatically.PCA results and plots will appear along with automated interpretation.

## Preparing your data {#sec-preparing}

"Your analysis is only as good as your data! Feed RAISINS high-quality data, and it will deliver powerful insights feed it messy data, and the results won‚Äôt be trustworthy."

1.  Create your dataset in MS Excel

2.  Build your dataset directly within the RAISINS app

## Preparing data in MS Excel {#sec-MSEXCEL}

Open a new blank sheet in MS Excel with only one sheet included, and avoid adding any unnecessary content. The dataset should follow a column-based format, where the first column represents the treatment or group to be compared‚Äîyou can name this column appropriately, such as ‚ÄúGroup‚Äù or ‚ÄúTreatment.‚Äù All characters under study (e.g., Appearance, Texture, Taste) should be arranged in separate columns, and each group should be repeated according to the number of replications. The file can be saved in CSV, XLS, or XLSX format, but CSV is recommended as it is lighter and enables faster loading. Ensure that there are no unwanted spaces in column names or group names. For reference, see the structure shown in Figure----. As illustrated in Figure 2.3, groups must appear repeatedly based on replications, and the data can also be arranged as shown in Figure-----.

## Creating dataset in RAISINS {#sec-MSEXCEL}

If you‚Äôre unsure about the correct format for creating a dataset, don‚Äôt worry - Raisins offers an option to create data directly within the app using the prescribed template. Here‚Äôs how:

-   Navigate to the **Create Data Tab**

-   Select the number of **Treatments**

-   Select number of **Replications**

-   Click on **Create** button

Model layout will appear as shown in **Figure-----**. Now you may enter the observations manually into the CSV file once downloaded, or paste the observations straight into the file provided. Once you have entered the observations in the layout, download the csv file and upload in `Analysis`tab!

![](CREATEDAT.webp){fig-align="center"}

## Model Datasets {#sec-Mode}

To test the app or better understand the data arrangement, we provide model datasets within the app. You can download them from the `Datasets` tab.

![](MODELDATASCREE.webp){fig-align="center"}

## FAQ‚Äôs {#sec-FAQ}

The app includes a dedicated FAQ tab to help clarify common doubts and guide users through various features. This section provides detailed answers to frequently asked questions, offering additional information and helpful tips to ensure a smooth user experience. If you‚Äôre ever unsure about how something works, the FAQ tab is a great place to start.

![](2.webp){fig-align="center"}

## USER {#sec-USER}

You can find all your account details - including usage percentage, plan validity, subscription type, and billing information - under the `User` tab. This section also allows you to download your GST invoice. We adhere to a strict data policy: each time you log in, a temporary instance of the app is created exclusively for you, which is automatically terminated when you log out. No uploaded data or generated results are stored, ensuring complete privacy and data security.
