    "text": "1.1 Example\nJithin Chandran1, Dr Pratheesh P Gopinath2\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric (distribution free) statistical test used to compare the medians of two or more independent groups when the data is not normally distributed or the assumptions of a one-way ANOVA are violated. It’s essentially a non-parametric equivalent of a one-way ANOVA, but instead of comparing means, it compares medians. It is named after William Kruskal and W. Allen Wallis, who developed it in 1952 (Kruskal and Wallis 1952).\nIn the Kruskal Wallis test, it is enough for the data to be in the form of ordinal variables, which means values that can be ranked or ordered. This is because the test does not use the actual differences between the values. Unlike ANOVA, which compares group means using real quantitative values and assumes normal distribution and equal variances, the Kruskal Wallis test works by converting all observations into ranks and then checking how these ranks are distributed across the groups. This makes the Kruskal Wallis test suitable for situations where the data are not normally distributed or where the measurements are not precise but can still be ordered in a meaningful way. In the illustration in Figure 1.1, you can see ANOVA uses the actual data values, while the Kruskal Wallis test replaces them with their ranks to see if the groups are significantly different.\nLet’s explore some practical situations in agricultural research where the Kruskal-Wallis test, also known as the Kruskal-Wallis H test, is applied.",

    "text": "1.4 Multivariate and AI\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test is usually used to compare one variable across several groups. It’s a non-parametric test, which means it doesn’t assume the data follows a normal distribution.Now, In the example given in the Section 1.1.1; if we have to analyse multiple variables ( Appearance, Color, Texture, Taste, Flavour) together, navigate to Multivariate tab. Multivariate analysis in kruskal wallis test helps you to compare different characters simultaneously !. The following part are the results of the multivariate analysis done for the Section 1.1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Scree Plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: Bi Plot\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scree plot given Figure 1.6 illustrates the proportion of variance explained by each principal component.PC1 accounts for approximately 61.08% of the variance in the dataset, while PC2 accounts for about 38.02% of the variance. Together, PC1 and PC2 explain approximately 99.1% of the total variance (termed as cumulative variance). Since PC1 explains more than 40% of the variance, a PC1-based index score is a strong consideration. Additionally, since both PCs explain more than 60% of the variance in the data, an index score based on both PCs is also appropriate. You should look upon the loadings of each variable in the below table and decide which PC-based index needs to be selected.\nThe biplot given Figure 1.7 provides a visual representation of the relationships among variables and treatments. Treatments with high values for a specific variable are positioned in the direction of that variable. The angle between variables in the biplot indicates their correlation—smaller angles suggest high positive correlation, while larger angles close to 90 degrees suggest weak or no correlation. Thus, the biplot aids in understanding the contributions of variables to each PC and in identifying patterns among treatments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.8: Index Plot\n\n\n\nBased on the loadings of PC’s an index will be calculated and scaled. An index plot given Figure 1.8 in the context of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), like the radar chart, visually represents the positions of variables (or samples) based on their scores along a principal component, here the first one (PC1). It signifies how much each variable contributes to the variance captured by PC1 and how variables are related to each other. Here the PCA results indicate that V3 and V4 are closely related and dominate the variance along PC1, while V1 and V2 form a separate cluster with opposing contributions.\nRAISINS is equipped with an AI-powered interpretation feature designed to assist users in comprehending the outcomes of statistical tests and data analysis. This functionality provides clear and concise summaries of analytical results, identifies statistically significant differences between groups, and offers informed suggestions for potential next steps or interpretations.The AI interpretation given below Figure 1.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.9: AI INTERPRETATION\n\n\n\nRAISINS enables users to draw meaningful conclusions without requiring advanced expertise in statistics.",

    "text": "For a long time, I have dreamed of writing a book that truly serves the needs of undergraduate students in agriculture—a book that demystifies statistics and makes it accessible and practical for their studies and research. Statistics, while being an essential tool in agricultural sciences, is often presented in ways that make it seem more complicated than it actually is. Textbooks in this field tend to delve into intricate details that go far beyond what most agricultural students require, leaving them overwhelmed and disconnected from the subject’s practical relevance.\nThis book is my humble attempt to change that. It has been written with undergraduate students in mind, focusing on the basics of statistics and their direct applications in agricultural research. Each chapter is designed to simplify complex concepts, making them clear, relatable, and easy to understand. While the primary audience is undergraduate students, this book can also serve as a helpful resource for anyone looking to brush up on the fundamentals of statistics.\nThe journey of writing this book has been greatly enriched by the feedback and insights of the students at the College of Agriculture, Vellayani. For two years, an earlier version of this book was made available on MeLON (Module for eLearning and Online Notes), our college’s online platform. The students, with their thoughtful suggestions and sharp observations, have helped refine the content and shape it into what it is today. Their enthusiasm and curiosity have been a constant source of inspiration throughout this process.\nI would also like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my co-authors, Dr. Manju Mary Paul, Dr. Adarsh V. S., and Mohammed Hisham M., whose expertise, commitment, and contributions have been invaluable in bringing this book to life. Their collaboration and dedication have greatly enhanced the quality and depth of this work.\nA special thanks to Jithin Chandran, Gaatha Prasad, Anjana Biwas T., and Varsha H. for their valuable suggestions and minor corrections. They were postgraduate students in Agricultural Statistics at the time of writing this book, and their support has significantly increased the quality of this work.\nI hope this textbook becomes a guiding light for students and researchers alike, helping them build a solid foundation in statistics while inspiring confidence in their ability to use these tools effectively. If this book makes statistics less intimidating and more approachable for even one reader, I will consider my efforts worthwhile.\nWith deep gratitude to my students, colleagues, and everyone who supported this work, I present this book as a tool to empower the next generation of agricultural scientists and researchers.\nDr. Pratheesh P.

    "text": "Welcome\nWelcome to the Textbook of Agricultural Statistics – a comprehensive resource thoughtfully crafted by the Department of Agricultural Statistics at the College of Agriculture, Vellayani, Kerala Agricultural University. This book was created to meet the need for a clear, accessible, and practical guide to statistics tailored for agricultural research.\nStatistics is an essential tool in agriculture, enabling researchers and practitioners to uncover patterns, validate results, and make data-driven decisions. However, the subject is often perceived as complex and challenging to master. This textbook is designed to change that perception, offering straightforward explanations and practical guidance to make statistical concepts approachable and applicable.\nAs John Tukey once said, “The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.” We have embraced this philosophy by incorporating clear examples, practical applications, and data visualizations to illustrate concepts and deepen understanding.\nWhile this book is primarily written with undergraduate students in mind, its simplicity and focus on real-world applications make it a valuable resource for a wide audience, including postgraduate students, researchers, and anyone seeking to build a strong foundation in statistics and experimental design.\nYou will find clear explanations, practical examples, and step-by-step instructions throughout the chapters, all tailored to the unique needs of agricultural studies. Our goal is to ensure that learners at all levels can confidently apply statistical methods to their work and research.\nWhether you are new to statistics or looking to revisit the basics with a fresh perspective, we hope this book serves as a supportive companion in your journey to understanding and applying statistical tools effectively in agriculture.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis book is the result of collaborative efforts among dedicated teachers and statisticians, but the majority of the reviewing, editing, and refinement has been inspired and shaped by the students.\nFor two years, this book was made available online on the MeLON (Module for eLearning and Online Notes) platform of the College of Agriculture, Vellayani. During this time, students provided valuable feedback, pointed out areas for improvement, and offered insights that greatly enhanced the quality and clarity of the content. We are sincerely grateful to all the students whose suggestions and input played a key role in the development of this textbook.\nWe would also like to thank the College of Agriculture, Vellayani, for fostering an environment that encourages learning, growth, and the sharing of ideas.\n\n\nNote from the Publisher\nThis textbook is published by PAPAYA, the publication division of Statoberry LLP, which is committed to providing high-quality educational resources for agricultural research.

    "section": "1.2 Theory",
    "text": "1.2 Theory\nYou can either read through the theory of the Kruskal-Wallis test below, or, if you’re a non-statistician interested only in the practical aspects, you may skip ahead to Section 1.3, where we explain the test with a practical example. The theory section outlines the key steps involved in performing the Kruskal-Wallis test. Understanding these concepts will help you carry out the analysis with clarity and confidence.\n\n1.2.1 Assumptions\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test relies on the following assumptions:\n\nNon-parametric: It does not assume a normal distribution of the data, making it suitable for non-normally distributed data\nIndependence of Observations: Each sample should be independent of the others, meaning there is no relationship or dependence between the observations within or across group\nOrdinal or Continuous Data: The data can be ordinal, meaning it can be ranked, or continuous.\n\n\n\nKey Features of Kruskal-Wallis Test\n\n\nNon-parametric: Unlike ANOVA, it does not assume normality or equal variances, making it suitable for non-normal data.\nExtension of the Mann-Whitney U test: It is essentially an extension of the Mann-Whitney U test, designed for more than two independent samples.\nRanking-based: Like the Mann-Whitney U test, the Kruskal-Wallis test relies on ranking the data rather than using raw values.\nTest statistic: The test calculates a statistic based on the ranked data to determine if significant differences exist between the groups.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Hypotheses\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test evaluates the following hypotheses:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNull Hypothesis (H₀)\n\n\n\nThe population medians of all groups are equal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Hypothesis (H₁)\n\n\n\nAt least one population median is different from the others.\n\n\n\n\nSteps in Kruskal-Wallis Test\n\n\nStep one: Sort and assign ranks to the data\nStep two: Add up the ranks for each group\nStep three: Calculate the H statistic\nStep four: Obtain and interpret the p-value\n\n\n\n1.2.3 The Test Statistic\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test statistic is calculated using the Equation 1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse this for Kruskal-Wallis Test\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\Large H = \\frac{12}{N(N+1)} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{R_i^2}{n_i} - 3(N+1)\n\\tag{1.1}\\] (Conover 1999)\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\\(N\\) is the total number of observations across all groups.\n\\(k\\) is the number of groups.\n\\(n_i\\) is the number of observations in group \\(i\\).\n\\(R_i\\) is the sum of ranks for group \\(i\\).\n\nWhen there are no ties in the data, \\(H\\) follows a chi-square distribution with \\(k-1\\) degrees of freedom. When ties exist, a correction factor given in the Equation 1.2 is applied.\n\n\n1.2.4 Correction for Ties\nIf there are tied values in the dataset, the test statistic is adjusted using:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse this for Kruskal-Wallis Test\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\Large H_{corrected} = \\frac{H}{1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{G} (t_i^3 - t_i)}{N^3 - N}}\n\\tag{1.2}\\]\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\\(G\\) is the number of groups of tied ranks.\n\\(t_i\\) is the number of tied values in the \\(i\\)-th group.\n\n\n\n1.2.5 Interpreting the Results\nThe test statistic H approximately follows a chi-square distribution with k - 1 degrees of freedom, where k is the number of groups. To determine if the null hypothesis can be rejected, the H test value is compared to an H critical value obtained from a chi-square table by cross reference the degrees of freedom (df), with the level of significance (ɑ). If H exceeds the critical value, reject the null hypothesis\nIf you reject the null hypothesis, you can conclude that at least one group is significantly different from the others and proceed for multiple comparison tests.When the Kruskal-Wallis test shows a significant difference, it does not provide information about which specific pairs of groups are different. This is where post-hoc tests, like the Dunn test, become essential. They perform pairwise comparisons to identify exactly which groups differ, addressing the limitation of the Kruskal-Wallis test.\n\n\nWhat is a post-hoc test?\n\nA post-hoc test is a follow-up analysis performed after finding a significant result in an overall statistical test (like ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis). Its purpose is to identify exactly which groups or treatments differ from each other. In other words, it helps pinpoint where the differences lie between multiple groups when the initial test shows that not all groups are the same.\n\n\n\n1.2.6 Post-hoc test\nWhen the Kruskal-Wallis test is significant, the following post hoc tests are commonly used for pairwise comparisons:\n\n\nDunn’s Test\nThe Dunn test is a post-hoc statistical procedure used in conjunction with the Kruskal-Wallis test. Used to determine which specific groups differ when the Kruskal-Wallis test indicates a significant difference among multiple groups. It compares the sums of ranks between every pair of groups by calculating the difference in their average ranks and standardizing this difference using an estimate of its standard error. The standardized test statistic in Dunn’s test is compared to the standard normal distribution (the Z-distribution) to determine significance. (Dunn 1964)\n\n\nLSD (Least Significant Difference) Test\nThe nonparametric LSD test is a post-hoc procedure used after a significant Kruskal-Wallis test to find which groups differ. It calculates the minimum significant difference (MSD) between group mean ranks based on an estimate of rank variance and uses the Student’s t-distribution to determine significance. Groups are compared pairwise by checking if their mean rank differences exceed the MSD. This test assumes similar group sizes and equal variance of ranks, offering a simpler method to classify groups when these conditions hold.(Mendiburu 2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich post-hoc test to use?\n\nWhen choosing a post-hoc test after performing a Kruskal-Wallis test, the decision largely depends on the characteristics of your data and the goals of your analysis. Dunn’s test is the most commonly recommended method for nonparametric pairwise comparisons because it adjusts for multiple testing and compares standardized rank differences using the normal distribution, making it suitable for groups of unequal sizes and providing a more conservative control of Type I errors. On the other hand, the nonparametric LSD method, such as the one implemented in the agricolae package, is simpler and uses the Student’s t-distribution along with a minimum significant difference calculated on ranks. This method works well when group sizes are approximately equal and when ease of interpretation is preferred, although it tends to be less conservative and may lead to more false positives. Overall, Dunn’s test is generally preferred for its rigor and wider acceptance, while the nonparametric LSD can be a practical alternative in balanced designs, provided the results are interpreted with caution.\n\n\n\n1.2.7 p Adjustment Method\nIn statistical hypothesis testing, p-values indicate the probability of observing results at least as extreme as those observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. When multiple tests are conducted, the risk of false positives (Type I errors) increases. P-value adjustment methods address this issue by controlling the overall error rate, ensuring reliable inference in multiple testing scenarios.\nDifferent p-adjustment methods are listed below, if you are interested you can click on them to read more:\n\nBonferroni\nHolm\nHommel\nBenjamini-Hochberg Procedure (BH)\nBenjamini-Yekutieli Procedure (BY)\nFalse Discovery Rate (q-value) Approach\n\n\n\nWhich p-adjustment method to use?\n\nIn agricultural research, it is a common practice to use no p-value adjustment (“none”) for multiple comparisons after tests like the Kruskal-Wallis. This is because agricultural experiments often involve smaller numbers of treatments and replications, where strict adjustments may be overly conservative and reduce the ability to detect meaningful differences. Researchers prefer to interpret results with caution rather than risk missing important findings due to overly strict error control. Nonetheless, the choice should always consider the study design, number of comparisons, and the consequences of Type I versus Type II errors in the specific context. However, When you have a large number of groups and sizable sample sizes, like in social science research, controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) becomes important to balance detecting true differences while limiting false positives. In such cases, the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure is often recommended. It controls the expected proportion of false discoveries (Type I errors) among the rejected hypotheses, which is less conservative than Bonferroni but still provides strong error control suitable for large-scale multiple testing. If your tests are dependent or more complex, the Benjamini-Yekutieli (BY) procedure can be used as it controls FDR under any dependency structure, though it is more conservative than BH.",

It integrates the power of R, Python, and AI to offer user-friendly, robust statistical tools. The platform is developed by STATOBERRY LLP, with mentorship from the Department of Agricultural Statistics, College of Agriculture, Vellayani, Kerala Agricultural University.\nHead to www.raisins.live where you can access various analytical modules. You can accesss the kruskal wallis test module from the analysis tools under social science section\n\nOnce you gets directed to the homepage, you can access the module by subscribing and filling out the google form provided. We offer student friendly subscription plans on monthly and annual basis. Once subscribed you can login to the web application using the credentials provided.\n\n1.3.1 A working example\nWe’ll guide you through the entire kruskal wallis test. For that let’s look how the analysis can be carried out using an Example 1 descibed in Section 1.1.1.\nYou can see in Figure 1.3 how the dataset should be arranged for analysis in RAISINS.\nData preparation in RAISINS is super easy it is well explained in the section Section 1.5.1. Model datasets for testing from the app is explained in Section 1.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Dataset arrangement for Kruskal-Wallis test in RAISINS\n\n\n\nOnce the dataset is ready, head onto the analysis tab in RAISINS and click on browse and upload the data in csv, xls or xlsx format. After uploading select the treatment and variables of interest(multiple variables can also be selected) and then click on run analysis. A complete publication ready results and tables will be generated. Results can be downloaded as pdf, html or word format.\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4\n\n\n\n\n\nResults table\n\nRAISINS generates result table in the format given in Figure 1.4 after the analysis.\nThe result table contains mean ± SD of each observed characters, Chi-square values and p-values showing test significance. The table contains chi-square statistics of each character and it’s significance(p-value). ** indicates significance at 1% level and * indicates significance at 5% level.\nFrom the result table, it can be concluded that the four drinks differ significantly in terms of appearance, texture, taste, and flavor, as indicated by the significant chi-square values for these characters. However, for the character color, the chi-square value is not significant, suggesting that there is no statistically meaningful difference in color among the four drinks.\nUsually while reporting Kruskal Wallis test, mean ranks are also reported so a additional feature to display means ranks is also available in the module.\nAfter a significant result in the Kruskal-Wallis test, a post-hoc comparison is automatically performed to identify which treatment groups differ significantly for each character under study. Dunn’s test will be performed by default, you can change the post-hoc test to LSD (Least significant difference test) by changing from the drop down menu. The results of the post-hoc test are summarized using letter groupings. Treatments that share the same letter are considered on par, meaning their mean ranks are not significantly different.\nFor example, in the case of the character Color, no letter groupings are shown, indicating that the Kruskal-Wallis test did not find significant differences among the treatments. However, for Appearance, treatments V1 and V2 are assigned the letter ‘a’, while V3 and V4 are assigned the letter ‘b’. This indicates that V1 and V2 form one group with similar appearance, while V3 and V4 form another, significantly different group. Since the mean ranks of V3 and V4 are higher, it suggests that these treatments were rated better in appearance.\nYou can interpret the results for the other characters in the same way: treatments with the same letter do not differ significantly in their effect on that character, while those with different letters do.\nFrom the results Figure 1.4 , it’s found that appearance wise, drinks V3 and V4 are the best, and by color V2 and V3 are the best. If your objective is to select treatments based on all characters, a multivariate analysis has to be performed. For that click on multivariate analysis tab.

    "section": "1.4 Multivariate and AI",
    "text": "1.4 Multivariate and AI\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test is usually used to compare one variable across several groups. Now, In our example of rating four drinks; if we have to identify best drink based on multiple variables (i.e. Appearance, Color, Texture, Taste, Flavour), navigate to Multivariate tab see ?fig-multiraisin. Multivariate analysis in kruskal wallis test helps you to compare different characters simultaneously!. Remember the PCA used for multivariate selection, is an exploratory technique, not an inferential method.\n A PCA will be automatically carried out based on the selected variables. PCA results and plots will appear along with automated interpretation.\nThe scree plot given Figure 1.7 illustrates the proportion of variance explained by each principal component. In our example PC1 accounts for approximately 61.08% of the variance in the dataset, while PC2 accounts for about 38.02% of the variance. Together, PC1 and PC2 explain approximately 99.1% of the total variance (termed as cumulative variance). Since PC1 explains more than 60% of the variance, a PC1-based index score is a strong consideration. Additionally, since both PCs explain more than 99% of the variance in the data, an index score based on both PCs is also appropriate. You should also take a look upon the loadings of each variable on the PCs and decide which PC-based index needs to be selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: Scree Plot\n\n\n\nThe loadings of each variable on PCs can be seen in Figure 1.8. Here Appearance, Color, Texture and Flavour has positive loading in PC1. So if you want to select best drink based on these four characters, you can use an Index based on PC1. In RAISINS this index is automatically calculated. You can see the index values calculated in Figure 1.9. More mathematical aspects of index construction and scalling can be read in the app itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.8: Loadings of each varaibles on PCs\n\n\n\nBased on index score it can be seen that, V3 has the highest index followed by V4. So Experimenter can select the drink V3 and V4. Also in some cases when the loadings of prefered variables are negative, a lower index value is preferred. Here to refine your selection, use the ‘Select cutoff for Scaled Index Score’ feature, where you can choose the cutoff percentage to select treatments above or below a certain threshold. The default cutoff is set at 75%. By toggling the up-arrow and down-arrow buttons below the cutoff selection, you can select the top or bottom percentage of treatments as per your preference. Selected treatments are highlighted in yellow in the table below, providing a clear visual cue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.9: Index score based on PCA\n\n\n\nThe index plot shown in Figure 1.10, used in the context of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), visually displays the positions of treatments (or groups) based on their index scores—similar to a radar chart. In Figure 1.10, V3 and V4 emerge as the selected drinks based on the four characters under study: appearance, color, texture, and flavour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.10: Index Plot\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the biplot in ?fig-Biplot clearly shows that V4 and V3 are positioned closer to three key characters—Appearance, Texture, and Flavour—indicating that these treatments scored highly for these attributes. If taste alone is the criterion, V2 emerges as the best candidate, as evident from Figure 1.5. On the other hand, V1 appears to be the least favourable option, having received low scores across all characters.\n Combining all this information, the experimenter can arrive at an overall conclusion that is statistically sound and contextually relevant to their study.\nRAISINS is equipped with an AI-powered RAISINS Assistant designed to assist users in comprehending the outcomes of statistical tests and data analysis. This functionality provides clear and concise summaries of results, identifies statistically significant differences between groups, and offers informed suggestions for potential next steps or interpretations.

    "text": "1.5 Preparing your data\nWhat truly matters is the quality of your data! As the saying goes, “garbage in, garbage out” — and this holds true for any software. To prepare your dataset for analysis in RAISINS, you have two options:\n\nCreate your dataset in MS Excel\n\nBuild your dataset directly within the RAISINS app\n\n\n1.5.1 Preparing data in MS Excel\nOpen a new blank sheet in MS Excel with only one sheet included, and avoid adding any unnecessary content. The dataset should follow a column-based format, where the first column represents the treatment or group to be compared—you can name this column appropriately, such as “Group” or “Treatment.” All characters under study (e.g., Appearance, Texture, Taste) should be arranged in separate columns, and each group should be repeated according to the number of replications. The file can be saved in CSV, XLS, or XLSX format, but CSV is recommended as it is lighter and enables faster loading. Ensure that there are no unwanted spaces in column names or group names. For reference, see the structure shown in Figure 1.12. As illustrated in Figure 1.3, groups must appear repeatedly based on replications, and the data can also be arranged as shown in Figure 1.13.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.12: Model1 showing how the prepared Excel file for upload should look like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.13: Model2 showing how the prepared Excel file for upload should look like\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset Creation Rules\n\n\nColumn Naming Convention\n\nNo spaces allowed in column names.\n\nUse underscores (_) or full stops (.) for separation.\nAvoid symbols and special characters like %,# etc\n\nData Arrangement\n\nStart data arrangement towards the upper-left corner.\n\nEnsure the row above the data is not blank.\n\nCell Management\n\nAvoid typing or deleting in cells without data.\n\nIf needed, select affected cells, right-click, and select Clear Contents.\n\nColumn Relevance\n\nName all columns meaningfully.\n\nExclude unnecessary columns not required for analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Save as CSV in MS Excel\n\n\nOpen Your Workbook\n\nEnsure your data is arranged properly with only one sheet.\n\nClick ‘File’ Menu\n\nGo to the top-left corner and click on File.\n\nChoose ‘Save As’ or ‘Save a Copy’\n\nSelect the location where you want to save your file.\n\nSet File Type to CSV\n\nIn the ‘Save as type’ dropdown menu, choose CSV (Comma delimited) (*.csv).\n\nName Your File\n\nEnter a relevant file name without spaces (use underscores if needed).\n\nClick ‘Save’\n\nClick Save to export the file.\n\n\n\n💡 Tip: Before saving, double-check that your data is on the first sheet and follows the required format (e.g., no empty rows above the data, meaningful column names).\n\n\n\n\n1.5.2 Creating dataset in RAISINS\nIf you’re unsure about the correct format for creating a dataset, don’t worry—Raisins offers an option to create data directly within the app using the prescribed template. Here’s how:\n➡️Navigate to the Create Data Tab\n➡️ Select the number of Treatments\n➡️ Select number of Replications\n➡️Click onCreate button**\nModel layout will appear as shown in Figure 1.14. Now you may enter the observations manually into the CSV file once downloaded, or paste the observations straight into the file provided. Once you have entered the observations in the layout, download the csv file and upload in Analysis tab!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.14: Creating dataset within RAISINS",
