    "text": "1.1 Example\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric statistical test used to compare the medians of two or more independent groups when the data is not normally distributed or the assumptions of a one-way ANOVA are violated. It’s essentially a non-parametric equivalent of a one-way ANOVA, but instead of comparing means, it compares medians. It is named after William Kruskal and W. Allen Wallis, who developed it in 1952.\nIn the Kruskal Wallis test, it is enough for the data to be in the form of ordinal variables, which means values that can be ranked or ordered. This is because the test does not use the actual differences between the values. Unlike ANOVA, which compares group means using real quantitative values and assumes normal distribution and equal variances, the Kruskal Wallis test works by converting all observations into ranks and then checking how these ranks are distributed across the groups. This makes the Kruskal Wallis test suitable for situations where the data are not normally distributed or where the measurements are not precise but can still be ordered in a meaningful way. In the illustration in Figure 1.1, you can see ANOVA uses the actual data values, while the Kruskal Wallis test replaces them with their ranks to see if the groups are significantly different.",

Each flavour is rated by five judges, giving five replications per group. A separate Kruskal Wallis test can be performed for each sensory attribute to check if there are significant differences in ratings among the flavours.\nAn agricultural extension researcher is evaluating the effectiveness of four training methods (T1 to T4) based on farmers’ knowledge gain. Each method is tested on five farmers, and their knowledge is scored after the training. These scores serve as replications. The Kruskal Wallis test can be used to determine if there is a significant difference in knowledge gain among the four training methods.\nAn agricultural extension researcher is comparing four different communication approaches (C1 to C4) for delivering farm advisories. Each method is tested on 10 farmers, who rate the clarity of the information received. These clarity scores serve as replications. The Kruskal Wallis test can be applied to determine whether there are significant differences in perceived clarity among the four communication methods.",

    "text": "For a long time, I have dreamed of writing a book that truly serves the needs of undergraduate students in agriculture—a book that demystifies statistics and makes it accessible and practical for their studies and research. Statistics, while being an essential tool in agricultural sciences, is often presented in ways that make it seem more complicated than it actually is. Textbooks in this field tend to delve into intricate details that go far beyond what most agricultural students require, leaving them overwhelmed and disconnected from the subject’s practical relevance.\nThis book is my humble attempt to change that. It has been written with undergraduate students in mind, focusing on the basics of statistics and their direct applications in agricultural research. Each chapter is designed to simplify complex concepts, making them clear, relatable, and easy to understand. While the primary audience is undergraduate students, this book can also serve as a helpful resource for anyone looking to brush up on the fundamentals of statistics.\nThe journey of writing this book has been greatly enriched by the feedback and insights of the students at the College of Agriculture, Vellayani. For two years, an earlier version of this book was made available on MeLON (Module for eLearning and Online Notes), our college’s online platform. The students, with their thoughtful suggestions and sharp observations, have helped refine the content and shape it into what it is today. Their enthusiasm and curiosity have been a constant source of inspiration throughout this process.\nI would also like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my co-authors, Dr. Manju Mary Paul, Dr. Adarsh V. S., and Mohammed Hisham M., whose expertise, commitment, and contributions have been invaluable in bringing this book to life. Their collaboration and dedication have greatly enhanced the quality and depth of this work.\nA special thanks to Jithin Chandran, Gaatha Prasad, Anjana Biwas T., and Varsha H. for their valuable suggestions and minor corrections. They were postgraduate students in Agricultural Statistics at the time of writing this book, and their support has significantly increased the quality of this work.\nI hope this textbook becomes a guiding light for students and researchers alike, helping them build a solid foundation in statistics while inspiring confidence in their ability to use these tools effectively. If this book makes statistics less intimidating and more approachable for even one reader, I will consider my efforts worthwhile.\nWith deep gratitude to my students, colleagues, and everyone who supported this work, I present this book as a tool to empower the next generation of agricultural scientists and researchers.\nDr. Pratheesh P.

This book was created to meet the need for a clear, accessible, and practical guide to statistics tailored for agricultural research.\nStatistics is an essential tool in agriculture, enabling researchers and practitioners to uncover patterns, validate results, and make data-driven decisions. However, the subject is often perceived as complex and challenging to master. This textbook is designed to change that perception, offering straightforward explanations and practical guidance to make statistical concepts approachable and applicable.\nAs John Tukey once said, “The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.” We have embraced this philosophy by incorporating clear examples, practical applications, and data visualizations to illustrate concepts and deepen understanding.\nWhile this book is primarily written with undergraduate students in mind, its simplicity and focus on real-world applications make it a valuable resource for a wide audience, including postgraduate students, researchers, and anyone seeking to build a strong foundation in statistics and experimental design.\nYou will find clear explanations, practical examples, and step-by-step instructions throughout the chapters, all tailored to the unique needs of agricultural studies. Our goal is to ensure that learners at all levels can confidently apply statistical methods to their work and research.\nWhether you are new to statistics or looking to revisit the basics with a fresh perspective, we hope this book serves as a supportive companion in your journey to understanding and applying statistical tools effectively in agriculture.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis book is the result of collaborative efforts among dedicated teachers and statisticians, but the majority of the reviewing, editing, and refinement has been inspired and shaped by the students.\nFor two years, this book was made available online on the MeLON (Module for eLearning and Online Notes) platform of the College of Agriculture, Vellayani. During this time, students provided valuable feedback, pointed out areas for improvement, and offered insights that greatly enhanced the quality and clarity of the content. We are sincerely grateful to all the students whose suggestions and input played a key role in the development of this textbook.\nWe would also like to thank the College of Agriculture, Vellayani, for fostering an environment that encourages learning, growth, and the sharing of ideas.\n\n\nNote from the Publisher\nThis textbook is published by PAPAYA, the publication division of Statoberry LLP, which is committed to providing high-quality educational resources for agricultural research.
