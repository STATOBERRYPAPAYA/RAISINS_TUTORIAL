    "text": "1.1 Example\nDr Pratheesh P Gopinath1, Jithin Chandran2, Mohammed Hisham M2\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric (distribution free) statistical test used to compare the medians of two or more independent groups when the data is not normally distributed or the assumptions of a one-way ANOVA are violated. It’s essentially a non-parametric equivalent of a one-way ANOVA, but instead of comparing means, it compares medians. It is named after William Kruskal and W. Allen Wallis, who developed it in 1952 (Kruskal and Wallis 1952).\nIn the Kruskal Wallis test, it is enough for the data to be in the form of ordinal variables, which means values that can be ranked or ordered. This is because the test does not use the actual differences between the values. Unlike ANOVA, which compares group means using real quantitative values and assumes normal distribution and equal variances, the Kruskal Wallis test works by converting all observations into ranks and then checking how these ranks are distributed across the groups. This makes the Kruskal Wallis test suitable for situations where the data are not normally distributed or where the measurements are not precise but can still be ordered in a meaningful way. In the illustration in Figure 1.1, you can see ANOVA uses the actual data values, while the Kruskal Wallis test replaces them with their ranks to see if the groups are significantly different.\nLet’s explore some practical situations in agricultural research where the Kruskal-Wallis test, also known as the Kruskal-Wallis H test, is applied.",

    "text": "1.4 Multivariate and AI\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test is usually used to compare one variable across several groups. It’s a non-parametric test, which means it doesn’t assume the data follows a normal distribution.Now, In the example given in the Section 1.1.1; if we have to analyse multiple variables ( Appearance, Color, Texture, Taste, Flavour) together, navigate to Multivariate tab. Multivariate analysis in kruskal wallis test helps you to compare different characters simultaneously !. The following part are the results of the multivariate analysis done for the Section 1.1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Scree Plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: Bi Plot\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scree plot given Figure 1.6 illustrates the proportion of variance explained by each principal component.PC1 accounts for approximately 61.08% of the variance in the dataset, while PC2 accounts for about 38.02% of the variance. Together, PC1 and PC2 explain approximately 99.1% of the total variance (termed as cumulative variance). Since PC1 explains more than 40% of the variance, a PC1-based index score is a strong consideration. Additionally, since both PCs explain more than 60% of the variance in the data, an index score based on both PCs is also appropriate. You should look upon the loadings of each variable in the below table and decide which PC-based index needs to be selected.\nThe biplot given Figure 1.7 provides a visual representation of the relationships among variables and treatments. Treatments with high values for a specific variable are positioned in the direction of that variable. The angle between variables in the biplot indicates their correlation—smaller angles suggest high positive correlation, while larger angles close to 90 degrees suggest weak or no correlation. Thus, the biplot aids in understanding the contributions of variables to each PC and in identifying patterns among treatments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.8: Index Plot\n\n\n\nBased on the loadings of PC’s an index will be calculated and scaled. An index plot given Figure 1.8 in the context of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), like the radar chart, visually represents the positions of variables (or samples) based on their scores along a principal component, here the first one (PC1). It signifies how much each variable contributes to the variance captured by PC1 and how variables are related to each other. Here the PCA results indicate that V3 and V4 are closely related and dominate the variance along PC1, while V1 and V2 form a separate cluster with opposing contributions.\nRAISINS is equipped with an AI-powered interpretation feature designed to assist users in comprehending the outcomes of statistical tests and data analysis. This functionality provides clear and concise summaries of analytical results, identifies statistically significant differences between groups, and offers informed suggestions for potential next steps or interpretations.The AI interpretation given below Figure 1.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.9: AI INTERPRETATION\n\n\n\nRAISINS enables users to draw meaningful conclusions without requiring advanced expertise in statistics.",

Statistics, while being an essential tool in agricultural sciences, is often presented in ways that make it seem more complicated than it actually is. Textbooks in this field tend to delve into intricate details that go far beyond what most agricultural students require, leaving them overwhelmed and disconnected from the subject’s practical relevance.\nThis book is my humble attempt to change that. It has been written with undergraduate students in mind, focusing on the basics of statistics and their direct applications in agricultural research. Each chapter is designed to simplify complex concepts, making them clear, relatable, and easy to understand. While the primary audience is undergraduate students, this book can also serve as a helpful resource for anyone looking to brush up on the fundamentals of statistics.\nThe journey of writing this book has been greatly enriched by the feedback and insights of the students at the College of Agriculture, Vellayani. For two years, an earlier version of this book was made available on MeLON (Module for eLearning and Online Notes), our college’s online platform. The students, with their thoughtful suggestions and sharp observations, have helped refine the content and shape it into what it is today. Their enthusiasm and curiosity have been a constant source of inspiration throughout this process.\nI would also like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my co-authors, Dr. Manju Mary Paul, Dr. Adarsh V. S., and Mohammed Hisham M., whose expertise, commitment, and contributions have been invaluable in bringing this book to life. Their collaboration and dedication have greatly enhanced the quality and depth of this work.\nA special thanks to Jithin Chandran, Gaatha Prasad, Anjana Biwas T., and Varsha H. for their valuable suggestions and minor corrections. They were postgraduate students in Agricultural Statistics at the time of writing this book, and their support has significantly increased the quality of this work.\nI hope this textbook becomes a guiding light for students and researchers alike, helping them build a solid foundation in statistics while inspiring confidence in their ability to use these tools effectively. If this book makes statistics less intimidating and more approachable for even one reader, I will consider my efforts worthwhile.\nWith deep gratitude to my students, colleagues, and everyone who supported this work, I present this book as a tool to empower the next generation of agricultural scientists and researchers.\nDr. Pratheesh P.

    "section": "1.2 Theory",
    "text": "1.2 Theory\nLet’s explore some of the theoretical aspects of the Kruskal-Wallis test. Each section outlines the key steps involved in conducting the analysis. Grasping these theoretical concepts equips you to perform the analysis smoothly and confidently.\n\n1.2.1 Assumptions\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test relies on the following assumptions:\n\nNon-parametric: It does not assume a normal distribution of the data, making it suitable for non-normally distributed data\nIndependence of Observations: Each sample should be independent of the others, meaning there is no relationship or dependence between the observations within or across group\nOrdinal or Continuous Data: The data should be ordinal, meaning it can be ranked, or continuous.\n\n\n\nKey Features of Kruskal-Wallis Test\n\n\nNon-parametric: Unlike ANOVA, it does not assume normality or equal variances, making it suitable for non-normal data.\nExtension of the Mann-Whitney U test: It is essentially an extension of the Mann-Whitney U test, designed for more than two independent samples.\nRanking-based: Like the Mann-Whitney U test, the Kruskal-Wallis test relies on ranking the data rather than using raw values.\nTest statistic: The test calculates a statistic based on the ranked data to determine if significant differences exist between the groups.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Hypotheses\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test evaluates the following hypotheses:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNull Hypothesis (H₀)\n\n\n\nThe population medians of all groups are equal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Hypothesis (H₁)\n\n\n\nAt least one population median is different from the others.\n\n\n\n\nSteps in Kruskal-Wallis Test\n\n\nStep one: Sort and assign ranks to the data\nStep two: Add up the ranks for each group\nStep three: Calculate the H statistic\nStep four: Obtain and interpret the p-value\n\n\n\n1.2.3 The Test Statistic\nThe Kruskal-Wallis test statistic is calculated using the Equation 1.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse this for Kruskal-Wallis Test\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\Large H = \\frac{12}{N(N+1)} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{R_i^2}{n_i} - 3(N+1)\n\\tag{1.1}\\]\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\\(N\\) is the total number of observations across all groups.\n\\(k\\) is the number of groups.\n\\(n_i\\) is the number of observations in group \\(i\\).\n\\(R_i\\) is the sum of ranks for group \\(i\\).\n\nWhen there are no ties in the data, \\(H\\) follows a chi-square distribution with \\(k-1\\) degrees of freedom. When ties exist, a correction factor given in the Equation 1.2 is applied.\n\n\n1.2.4 Correction for Ties\nIf there are tied values in the dataset, the test statistic is adjusted using:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse this for Kruskal-Wallis Test\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\Large H_{corrected} = \\frac{H}{1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{G} (t_i^3 - t_i)}{N^3 - N}}\n\\tag{1.2}\\]\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\\(G\\) is the number of groups of tied ranks.\n\\(t_i\\) is the number of tied values in the \\(i\\)-th group.\n\n\n\n1.2.5 Interpreting the Results\nThe test statistic H approximately follows a chi-square distribution with k - 1 degrees of freedom, where k is the number of groups. To determine if the null hypothesis can be rejected, the H test value is compared to an H critical value obtained from a chi-square table by cross reference the degrees of freedom (df), with the level of significance (ɑ). If H exceeds the critical value, reject the null hypothesis\nIf you reject the null hypothesis, you can conclude that at least one group is significantly different from the others and proceed for multiple comparison tests.When the Kruskal-Wallis test shows a significant difference, it does not provide information about which specific pairs of groups are different. This is where post-hoc tests, like the Dunn test, become essential. They perform pairwise comparisons to identify exactly which groups differ, addressing the limitation of the Kruskal-Wallis test.\n\n\nWhat is a post-hoc test?\n\nA post-hoc test is a follow-up analysis performed after finding a significant result in an overall statistical test (like ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis). Its purpose is to identify exactly which groups or treatments differ from each other. In other words, it helps pinpoint where the differences lie between multiple groups when the initial test shows that not all groups are the same.\n\n\n\n1.2.6 Post-hoc test\nWhen the Kruskal-Wallis test is significant, the following post hoc tests are commonly used for pairwise comparisons:\n\n\nDunn’s Test\nThe Dunn test is a post-hoc statistical procedure used in conjunction with the Kruskal-Wallis test. Used to determine which specific groups differ when the Kruskal-Wallis test indicates a significant difference among multiple groups.It compares the sums of ranks between every pair of groups by calculating the difference in their average ranks and standardizing this difference using an estimate of its standard error. The standardized test statistic in Dunn’s test is compared to the standard normal distribution (the Z-distribution) to determine significance. (Dunn 1964)\n\n\nLSD (Least Significant Difference) Test\nThe nonparametric LSD test is a post-hoc procedure used after a significant Kruskal-Wallis test to find which groups differ. It calculates the minimum significant difference (MSD) between group mean ranks based on an estimate of rank variance and uses the Student’s t-distribution to determine significance. Groups are compared pairwise by checking if their mean rank differences exceed the MSD. This test assumes similar group sizes and equal variance of ranks, offering a simpler method to classify groups when these conditions hold.(Mendiburu 2020)\n\n\n\n\nWhich post-hoc test to use?\n\nWhen choosing a post-hoc test after performing a Kruskal-Wallis test, the decision largely depends on the characteristics of your data and the goals of your analysis. Dunn’s test is the most commonly recommended method for nonparametric pairwise comparisons because it adjusts for multiple testing and compares standardized rank differences using the normal distribution, making it suitable for groups of unequal sizes and providing a more conservative control of Type I errors. On the other hand, the nonparametric LSD method, such as the one implemented in the agricolae package, is simpler and uses the Student’s t-distribution along with a minimum significant difference calculated on ranks. This method works well when group sizes are approximately equal and when ease of interpretation is preferred, although it tends to be less conservative and may lead to more false positives. Overall, Dunn’s test is generally preferred for its rigor and wider acceptance, while the nonparametric LSD can be a practical alternative in balanced designs, provided the results are interpreted with caution.\n\n\n\n1.2.7 p Adjustment Method\nIn statistical hypothesis testing, p-values indicate the probability of observing results at least as extreme as those observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. When multiple tests are conducted, the risk of false positives (Type I errors) increases. P-value adjustment methods address this issue by controlling the overall error rate, ensuring reliable inference in multiple testing scenarios.\nYou can select different p-adjustment methods:\n\nBonferroni\nHolm\nHommel\nBenjamini-Hochberg Procedure (BH)\nBenjamini-Yekutieli Procedure (BY)\nFalse Discovery Rate (q-value) Approach\n\n\n\nWhich p-adjustment method to use?\n\nIn agricultural research, it is a common practice to use no p-value adjustment (“none”) for multiple comparisons after tests like the Kruskal-Wallis. This is because agricultural experiments often involve smaller numbers of treatments and replications, where strict adjustments may be overly conservative and reduce the ability to detect meaningful differences. Researchers prefer to interpret results with caution rather than risk missing important findings due to overly strict error control. Nonetheless, the choice should always consider the study design, number of comparisons, and the consequences of Type I versus Type II errors in the specific context. However, When you have a large number of groups and sizable sample sizes, like in social science research, controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) becomes important to balance detecting true differences while limiting false positives. In such cases, the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure is often recommended. It controls the expected proportion of false discoveries (Type I errors) among the rejected hypotheses, which is less conservative than Bonferroni but still provides strong error control suitable for large-scale multiple testing. If your tests are dependent or more complex, the Benjamini-Yekutieli (BY) procedure can be used as it controls FDR under any dependency structure, though it is more conservative than BH.",

    "text": "1.3 Getting started in Raisins\nRAISINS is an innovative online platform that simplifies data analysis for agricultural research—no downloads required. It integrates the power of R, Python, and AI to offer user-friendly, robust statistical tools. The platform is developed by STATOBERRY LLP, with mentorship from the Department of Agricultural Statistics, College of Agriculture, Vellayani, Kerala Agricultural University.\nHead to www.raisins.live where you can access various analytical modules. You can accesss the kruskal wallis test module from the analysis tools under social science section\n\nOnce you gets directed to the homepage, you can access the module by subscribing and filling out the google form provided. We offer student friendly subscription plans on monthly and annual basis. Once subscribed you can login to the web application using the credentials provided.\n\n1.3.1 A working example\nWe’ll guide you through the entire kruskal wallis test. For that let’s look how the analysis can be carried out using an Example 1 descibed in Section 1.1.1.\nYou can see in Figure 1.3 how the dataset should be arranged for analysis in RAISINS.\nData preparation in RAISINS is super easy it is well explained in the section Section 1.5.1. Model datasets for testing from the app is explained in Section 1.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Dataset arrangement for Kruskal-Wallis test in RAISINS\n\n\n\nOnce the dataset is ready, head onto the analysis tab in RAISINS and click on browse and upload the data in csv, xls or xlsx format. After uploading select the Treatment and variables of interest(multiple variables can also be selected) and then click on run analysis. A complete publication ready results and tables will be generated. Results can be downloaded as pdf, html or word format.\n\n\n1.3.2 Results\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4\n\n\n\nRAISINS generates result table in the format given in Figure 1.4 after the analysis.\nThe result table contains mean ± SD of each observed characters, Chi-square values and p-values showing test significance. The table contains chi-square statistics of each character and it’s significance(p-value). ** indicates significance at 1% level and * indicates significance at 5% level.\nFrom the result table, it can be concluded that the four drinks differ significantly in terms of appearance, texture, taste, and flavor, as indicated by the significant chi-square values for these characters. However, for the character color, the chi-square value is not significant, suggesting that there is no statistically meaningful difference in color among the four drinks.\nUsually while reporting Kruskal Wallis test, mean ranks are also reported so a additional feature to display means ranks is also available in the module.\nAfter a significant result in the Kruskal-Wallis test, a post-hoc comparison is automatically performed to identify which treatment groups differ significantly for each character under study. Dunn’s test will be performed by default, you can change the post-hoc test to LSD (Least significant difference test) by changing from the drop down menu. The results of the post-hoc test are summarized using letter groupings. Treatments that share the same letter are considered on par, meaning their mean ranks are not significantly different.\nFor example, in the case of the character Color, no letter groupings are shown, indicating that the Kruskal-Wallis test did not find significant differences among the treatments. However, for Appearance, treatments V1 and V2 are assigned the letter ‘a’, while V3 and V4 are assigned the letter ‘b’. This indicates that V1 and V2 form one group with similar appearance, while V3 and V4 form another, significantly different group. Since the mean ranks of V3 and V4 are higher, it suggests that these treatments were rated better in appearance.\nYou can interpret the results for the other characters in the same way: treatments with the same letter do not differ significantly in their effect on that character, while those with different letters do.\n\n\n1.3.3 Customization tabs\nAdditionally You can also change the decimal points, multiple comparison tests, padjustment method, font and sifgnificance level according to your requireent as shown in Figure 1.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: Customising the results\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.4 Plots and graphs\nRAISINS offers you various plots for visualizing the analysis results.These plots can also be customised using the gear button available at the left side of each plot. These plots can also be downloaded as PNG format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBox plot\n\n\n\nA box plot displays the distribution of data with a five-number summary: minimum, Q1, median, Q3, and maximum. It vividly highlights central tendencies, variability, and outliers with a splash of clarity!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPairs plot\n\n\n\nA correlation plot, often called a correlation matrix or heatmap, is a visual tool used to display the correlation coefficients between multiple variables in a dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBar plot\n\n\n\nA bar plot paints categorical data with vibrant bars, their heights dancing to the tune of values or frequencies, perfect for comparing categories with flair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnected plot\n\n\n\nA connected plot links data points with flowing lines, tracing trends across time or other variables with a dynamic, storytelling vibe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean Value Plot\n\n\n\nA mean value plot shines a spotlight on group averages, with error bars adding a touch of drama to show variability or confidence intervals across categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViolin plot\n\n\n\nA violin plot blends a box plot’s structure with a density plot’s elegance, its curves swaying to reveal data distribution and density with vibrant charm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.5 How to customize\nRAISIN provides user various customization features for the plots to enhance the visualization according to the requirement of the user.Click on the below images to get a clear idea on the customizing features\n\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n  ×",
