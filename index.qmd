# Welcome {.unnumbered}

Dear Reader,

Welcome to *The RAISINS Handbook*—an online guide born from a shared vision, sustained by passion, and dedicated to every student, scholar, and researcher striving to bring clarity and rigour to agricultural research. This handbook is free to read.

It all began with a simple idea: to make data analysis accessible, accurate, and stress-free for the agricultural research community. Back in 2020, we introduced **GRAPES** (General R-based Analysis Platform Empowered by Statistics) [www.kaugrapes.com](https://www.kaugrapes.com) —a humble, browser-based tool designed for the students and researchers of Kerala Agricultural University. Little did we know then, it would grow into a trusted companion for more than 100,000 users worldwide and earn citations in over 100 Scopus-indexed journals.

But growth brings new challenges. GRAPES, originally tailored for local use, struggled to keep pace with the scale and expectations of a global audience. We knew we needed to build something more robust—something that could not just meet, but anticipate the needs of modern agricultural research.

That dream took shape in 2024, when a spirited team of young statisticians came together to form [STATOBERRY LLP](https://www.statoberry.com/), under the mentorship of Dr. Pratheesh P. Gopinath, Head of the Department of Agricultural Statistics, College of Agriculture, Vellayani. From this dynamic collaboration emerged online web application for reseacrh data analysis in agriculture **RAISINS**—**R** and **AI** **S**olutions in **IN**ferential **S**tatistics. RAISINS can be accessed at [www.raisins.live](https://www.raisins.live/) 

[RAISINS](https://www.raisins.live/) is not just another software. It is a complete ecosystem that brings together the power of R, Python, and AI in a seamless, point-and-click interface. Whether you're working on design of experiments, social science surveys, or advanced statistical genetics, RAISINS simplifies the process, automates best practices, and delivers publication-ready results—without requiring you to write a single line of code.

This handbook is your step-by-step guide to harnessing RAISINS for agricultural research. It is designed to take you beyond the "how" into the "why"—helping you not just use the software, but understand the statistical foundation behind it. Whether you are preparing your MSc thesis, conducting doctoral research, or mentoring future scientists, we hope this book becomes a reliable companion in your journey.

## Why RAISINS is Paid—and Why That Matters

We are often asked: “R is open source and free. GRAPES is free. So why is RAISINS a paid platform?” It’s a fair question—and it deserves an honest answer.

RAISINS is the result of years of work and sleepless nights by a dedicated team of statisticians who wanted to create something meaningful for the agricultural community. Hosting the platform on scalable servers, ensuring data security, continuously updating features—all of this incurs real costs. We’ve kept our plans as affordable as possible. It’s not about profit. It’s about sustainability. It’s about keeping RAISINS alive, relevant, and growing for the benefit of everyone.

## A Shared Mission

Our dream is simple, yet ambitious: *to bring all agricultural data analysis under one intuitive platform.* From field layout designs to psychometric validations, from varietal trials to farmer surveys—RAISINS is our humble attempt to unify, simplify, and empower.

As you go through these pages and explore the features of RAISINS, we hope you feel the heart and hard work that went into every module. This book is a tribute to our users, our mentors, our students, and the wider agricultural research community that keeps asking better questions—and demanding better answers.  

This handbook is more than just a guide—it's a dynamic, evolving resource built to grow alongside RAISINS and its users. By keeping it online, we can quickly incorporate your feedback, introduce new features, and reflect updates to the platform in real time. Whether we're adding new analysis modules or refining existing ones, this living document ensures you always have the most accurate and up-to-date guidance at your fingertips.


Thank you for joining us on this journey.

With warmth and gratitude,
**Team RAISINS**
