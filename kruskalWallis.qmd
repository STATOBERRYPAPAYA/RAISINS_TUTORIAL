The Kruskal-Wallis test is a **non-parametric** (distribution free) statistical test used to compare the medians of two or more independent groups when the data is not normally distributed or the assumptions of a **one-way ANOVA** are violated. It's essentially a non-parametric equivalent of a one-way ANOVA, but instead of comparing means, it compares medians. It is named after **William Kruskal and W. Allen Wallis**, who developed it in 1952 [@kwtref].

In the Kruskal Wallis test, it is enough for the data to be in the form of ordinal variables, which means values that can be ranked or ordered. This is because the test does not use the actual differences between the values. Unlike ANOVA, which compares group means using real quantitative values and assumes normal distribution and equal variances, the Kruskal Wallis test works by converting all observations into ranks and then checking how these ranks are distributed across the groups. This makes the Kruskal Wallis test suitable for situations where the data are not normally distributed or where the measurements are not precise but can still be ordered in a meaningful way. In the illustration in @fig-anvakwt, you can see ANOVA uses the actual data values, while the Kruskal Wallis test replaces them with their ranks to see if the groups are significantly different.

## Example 

Let's explore some practical situations in agricultural research where the Kruskal-Wallis test, also known as the Kruskal-Wallis H test, is applied.

### Study Context {#sec-exkwt}

<p>

1.  A food scientist is evaluating four drink flavours (V1 to V4) based on five sensory attributes: appearance, color, texture, taste, and flavour. Each flavour is rated by ten judges, so there are ten replications (ratings) per flavour. A Kruskal-Wallis test can be performed separately for each sensory attribute to check whether there are significant differences in ratings among the four flavours.<a href="#example1" class="toggle-image" data-target="example-image1">Example1</a>

</p>

:::

<p>

2.  An agricultural extension researcher is evaluating the effectiveness of four training methods (T1 to T4) based on how much knowledge farmers gain from each. Each method is tested on five different farmers, and their knowledge is scored after the training. Since each method is tested on five farmers, there are five replications per method. The Kruskal-Wallis test can be used to determine whether there is a significant difference in knowledge gain among the four training methods.<a href="#example2" class="toggle-image" data-target="example-image2">Example2</a>

</p>

::: {#example-image2 style="display: none;"}
<img src="images/kwt/ex2.png" alt="Kruskal-Wallis Test Example2" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
:::

<p>

3.  An agricultural extension researcher is comparing four different communication methods (C1 to C4) for delivering farm advisories. Each method is tested on a separate group of 10 farmers, who rate the clarity of the information received. So, there are 10 farmers (or replications) for each method, making a total of 40 ratings. The Kruskal-Wallis test can be used to check whether there are significant differences in the clarity ratings among the four communication methods.<a href="#example3" class="toggle-image" data-target="example-image3">Example3</a>

## Theory

You can either read through the theory of the Kruskal-Wallis test below, or, if you're a non-statistician interested only in the practical aspects, you may skip ahead to @sec-rasins, where we explain the test with a practical example. The theory section outlines the key steps involved in performing the Kruskal-Wallis test. Understanding these concepts will help you carry out the analysis with clarity and confidence.

### Assumptions

The Kruskal-Wallis test relies on the following assumptions:

-   **Non-parametric**: It does not assume a normal distribution of the data, making it suitable for non-normally distributed data

-   **Independence of Observations**: Each sample should be independent of the others, meaning there is no relationship or dependence between the observations within or across group

-   **Ordinal or Continuous Data**: The data can be ordinal, meaning it can be ranked, or continuous.

<details>

<summary>Key Features of Kruskal-Wallis Test</summary>

-   **Non-parametric**: Unlike ANOVA, it does not assume normality or equal variances, making it suitable for non-normal data.
-   **Extension of the Mann-Whitney U test**: It is essentially an extension of the Mann-Whitney U test, designed for more than two independent samples.
-   **Ranking-based**: Like the Mann-Whitney U test, the Kruskal-Wallis test relies on ranking the data rather than using raw values.
-   **Test statistic**: The test calculates a statistic based on the ranked data to determine if significant differences exist between the groups.

</details>

### Hypotheses

The Kruskal-Wallis test evaluates the following hypotheses:

::: {.callout-note title="Null Hypothesis (H₀)"}
The population medians of all groups are equal.
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)"}
At least one population median is different from the others.
:::

<details>

<summary>Steps in Kruskal-Wallis Test</summary>

-   Step one: Sort and assign ranks to the data

-   Step two: Add up the ranks for each group

-   Step three: Calculate the H statistic

-   Step four: Obtain and interpret the p-value

### The Test Statistic

The Kruskal-Wallis test statistic is calculated using the @eq-kwt1

::: {.callout-tip title="Use this for Kruskal-Wallis Test"}
$$
\Large H = \frac{12}{N(N+1)} \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{R_i^2}{n_i} - 3(N+1)
$$ {#eq-kwt1} [@conover1999practical]
:::

Where:

-   $N$ is the total number of observations across all groups.
-   $k$ is the number of groups.
-   $n_i$ is the number of observations in group $i$.
-   $R_i$ is the sum of ranks for group $i$.

When there are no ties in the data, $H$ follows a chi-square distribution with $k-1$ degrees of freedom. When ties exist, a correction factor given in the @eq-kwt2 is applied.

### Correction for Ties

If there are tied values in the dataset, the test statistic is adjusted using:

::: {.callout-tip title="Use this for Kruskal-Wallis Test"}
$$
\Large H_{corrected} = \frac{H}{1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{G} (t_i^3 - t_i)}{N^3 - N}}
$$ {#eq-kwt2}
:::

Where:

-   $G$ is the number of groups of tied ranks.
-   $t_i$ is the number of tied values in the $i$-th group.

### Interpreting the Results

The test statistic H approximately follows a chi-square distribution with k - 1 degrees of freedom, where k is the number of groups. To determine if the null hypothesis can be rejected, the H test value is compared to an H critical value obtained from a chi-square table by cross reference the degrees of freedom (df), with the level of significance (ɑ). If H exceeds the critical value, reject the null hypothesis

If you reject the null hypothesis, you can conclude that at least one group is significantly different from the others and proceed for multiple comparison tests.When the Kruskal-Wallis test shows a significant difference, it does not provide information about which specific pairs of groups are different. This is where post-hoc tests, like the Dunn test, become essential. They perform pairwise comparisons to identify exactly which groups differ, addressing the limitation of the Kruskal-Wallis test.

<details>

<summary>What is a post-hoc test?</summary>

A post-hoc test is a follow-up analysis performed after finding a significant result in an overall statistical test (like ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis). Its purpose is to identify exactly which groups or treatments differ from each other. In other words, it helps pinpoint where the differences lie between multiple groups when the initial test shows that not all groups are the same.

</details>

### Post-hoc test {#sec-post}

When the Kruskal-Wallis test is significant, the following post hoc tests are commonly used for pairwise comparisons:

::: {style="display: flex; gap: 2em;"}
::: dunn-box
**Dunn's Test**\
The Dunn test is a post-hoc statistical procedure used in conjunction with the Kruskal-Wallis test. Used to determine which specific groups differ when the Kruskal-Wallis test indicates a significant difference among multiple groups. It compares the sums of ranks between every pair of groups by calculating the difference in their average ranks and standardizing this difference using an estimate of its standard error. The standardized test statistic in Dunn’s test is compared to the standard normal distribution (the Z-distribution) to determine significance. [@dunn1964]
:::

::: lsd-box
**LSD (Least Significant Difference) Test**\
The nonparametric LSD test is a post-hoc procedure used after a significant Kruskal-Wallis test to find which groups differ. It calculates the minimum significant difference (MSD) between group mean ranks based on an estimate of rank variance and uses the Student’s t-distribution to determine significance. Groups are compared pairwise by checking if their mean rank differences exceed the MSD. This test assumes similar group sizes and equal variance of ranks, offering a simpler method to classify groups when these conditions hold.[@agricolae]

<details>

<summary>Which post-hoc test to use?</summary>

When choosing a post-hoc test after performing a Kruskal-Wallis test, the decision largely depends on the characteristics of your data and the goals of your analysis. Dunn’s test is the most commonly recommended method for nonparametric pairwise comparisons because it adjusts for multiple testing and compares standardized rank differences using the normal distribution, making it suitable for groups of unequal sizes and providing a more conservative control of Type I errors. On the other hand, the nonparametric LSD method, such as the one implemented in the agricolae package, is simpler and uses the Student’s t-distribution along with a minimum significant difference calculated on ranks. This method works well when group sizes are approximately equal and when ease of interpretation is preferred, although it tends to be less conservative and may lead to more false positives. Overall, Dunn’s test is generally preferred for its rigor and wider acceptance, while the nonparametric LSD can be a practical alternative in balanced designs, provided the results are interpreted with caution.

### p Adjustment Method {#p-adjustment}

In statistical hypothesis testing, p-values indicate the probability of observing results at least as extreme as those observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. When multiple tests are conducted, the risk of false positives (Type I errors) increases. P-value adjustment methods address this issue by controlling the overall error rate, ensuring reliable inference in multiple testing scenarios.

Different p-adjustment methods are listed below, if you are interested you can click on them to read more:

-   [Bonferroni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction)
-   [Holm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holm%E2%80%93Bonferroni_method)
-   [Hommel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_testing_correction#Hommel)
-   [Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure (BH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate#Benjamini%E2%80%93Hochberg_procedure)
-   [Benjamini-Yekutieli Procedure (BY)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate#Benjamini%E2%80%93Yekutieli_procedure)
-   [False Discovery Rate (q-value) Approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate)

<details>

<summary>Which p-adjustment method to use?</summary>

In agricultural research, it is a common practice to use no p-value adjustment (“none”) for multiple comparisons after tests like the Kruskal-Wallis. This is because agricultural experiments often involve smaller numbers of treatments and replications, where strict adjustments may be overly conservative and reduce the ability to detect meaningful differences. Researchers prefer to interpret results with caution rather than risk missing important findings due to overly strict error control. Nonetheless, the choice should always consider the study design, number of comparisons, and the consequences of Type I versus Type II errors in the specific context. However, When you have a large number of groups and sizable sample sizes, like in social science research, controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) becomes important to balance detecting true differences while limiting false positives. In such cases, the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure is often recommended. It controls the expected proportion of false discoveries (Type I errors) among the rejected hypotheses, which is less conservative than Bonferroni but still provides strong error control suitable for large-scale multiple testing. If your tests are dependent or more complex, the Benjamini-Yekutieli (BY) procedure can be used as it controls FDR under any dependency structure, though it is more conservative than BH.

### A working example

We’ll guide you through the entire Kruskal-Wallis test step by step. To begin, let’s look at how the analysis can be carried out using Example 1 described in @sec-exkwt. For clarity, here’s a quick recap of the example: A food scientist is evaluating four drink flavours (V1 to V4) based on five sensory attributes—appearance, color, texture, taste, and flavour. Each flavour is rated by ten judges, providing ten replications (ratings) per flavour.

The dataset format required for analysis in RAISINS is illustrated in @fig-raisinkwt.

Preparing data in RAISINS is simple and straightforward. Detailed instructions are provided in @sec-createData. Additionally, model datasets are available within the app for testing purposes, as explained in @sec-Datasets. See how dataset is arranged for analysis @fig-raisinkwt.

![Dataset arrangement for analyzing sensory ratings of four drink flavours using the Kruskal-Wallis test in RAISINS](images/kwt/ex1.png){#fig-raisinkwt fig-align="center" width="558"}

Once the dataset is ready, head onto the `Analysis` tab in RAISINS and click on `Browse` and upload the data in csv, xls or xlsx format. After uploading select the treatment and variables of interest(multiple variables can also be selected) and then click on `Run Analysis`. A complete publication ready results and tables will be generated. Results can be downloaded as pdf, html or word format. See @fig-analysistab for marked Analysis window in RAISINS.

![Analysis window in RAISINS](images/kwt/Analysis.png){#fig-analysistab fig-align="center"}

# Results {#sec-results}

RAISINS generates result table in the format given in @fig-res1 after the analysis.\
The result table contains mean ± SD of each observed characters, Chi-square values and p-values showing test significance. The table contains chi-square statistics of each character and it's significance(p-value). \*\* indicates significance at 1% level and \* indicates significance at 5% level.

![Result table in RAISINS](images/kwt/result.png){#fig-res1 fig-align="center" width="703"}

From the result table, it can be concluded that the four drinks differ significantly in terms of appearance, texture, taste, and flavor, as indicated by the significant chi-square values for these characters. However, for the character color, the chi-square value is not significant, suggesting that there is no statistically meaningful difference in color among the four drinks.

Usually while reporting Kruskal Wallis test, mean ranks are also reported so a additional feature to display means ranks is also available in the module.

After a significant result in the Kruskal-Wallis test, a post-hoc comparison is automatically performed to identify which treatment groups differ significantly for each character under study. Dunn's test will be performed by default, you can change the post-hoc test to LSD (Least significant difference test) by changing from the drop down menu. The results of the post-hoc test are summarized using letter groupings. Treatments that share the same letter are considered on par, meaning their mean ranks are not significantly different.

For example, in the case of the character *Color*, no letter groupings are shown, indicating that the Kruskal-Wallis test did not find significant differences among the treatments. However, for *Appearance*, treatments V1 and V2 are assigned the letter ‘a’, while V3 and V4 are assigned the letter ‘b’. This indicates that V1 and V2 form one group with similar appearance, while V3 and V4 form another, significantly different group. Since the mean ranks of V3 and V4 are higher, it suggests that these treatments were rated better in appearance.

You can interpret the results for the other characters in the same way: treatments with the same letter do not differ significantly in their effect on that character, while those with different letters do.

From the results @fig-res1 , it's found that appearance wise, drinks V3 and V4 are the best, and by color V2 and V3 are the best. If your objective is to select treatments based on all characters, a multivariate analysis has to be performed. For that click on `Multivaraite` tab. The results as mentioned in @sec-multi gives you the best treatment based on all the observed characters.

## Multivariate and AI {#sec-multi}

The Kruskal-Wallis test is usually used to compare one variable across several groups. Now, In our example of rating four drinks; if we have to identify best drink based on multiple variables (*i.e.* Appearance, Color, Texture, Taste, Flavour), navigate to `Multivariate` tab see @fig-multiraisin. Multivariate analysis in kruskal wallis test helps you to compare different characters simultaneously!. Remember the PCA used for multivariate selection, is an exploratory technique, not an inferential method.

![Multivariate tab in RAISINS](images/kwt/multi.png){#fig-multiraisin}

A PCA will be automatically carried out based on the selected variables. PCA results and plots will appear along with automated interpretation.

The scree plot given @fig-scree illustrates the proportion of variance explained by each principal component. In our example PC1 accounts for approximately 61.08% of the variance in the dataset, while PC2 accounts for about 38.02% of the variance. Together, PC1 and PC2 explain approximately 99.1% of the total variance (termed as cumulative variance). Since PC1 explains more than 60% of the variance, a PC1-based index score is a strong consideration. Additionally, since both PCs explain more than 99% of the variance in the data, an index score based on both PCs is also appropriate. You should also take a look upon the loadings of each variable on the PCs and decide which PC-based index needs to be selected.

![Scree Plot](images/kwt/scree.png){#fig-scree}

The loadings of each variable on PCs can be seen in @fig-loadings. Here Appearance, Color, Texture and Flavour has positive loading in PC1. So if you want to select best drink based on these four characters, you can use an Index based on PC1. In RAISINS this index is automatically calculated. You can see the index values calculated in @fig-indexscore. More mathematical aspects of index construction and scalling can be read in the app itself.

![Loadings of each varaibles on PCs](images/kwt/loadings.png){#fig-loadings}

Based on index score it can be seen that, V3 has the highest index followed by V4. So Experimenter can select the drink V3 and V4. Also in some cases when the loadings of prefered variables are negative, a lower index value is preferred. Here to refine your selection, use the 'Select cutoff for Scaled Index Score' feature, where you can choose the cutoff percentage to select treatments above or below a certain threshold. The default cutoff is set at 75%. By toggling the up-arrow and down-arrow buttons below the cutoff selection, you can select the top or bottom percentage of treatments as per your preference. Selected treatments are highlighted in yellow in the table below, providing a clear visual cue.

![Index score based on PCA](images/kwt/index_score.png){#fig-indexscore fig-align="center"}

The index plot shown in @fig-index, used in the context of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), visually displays the positions of treatments (or groups) based on their index scores—similar to a radar chart. In @fig-index, V3 and V4 emerge as the selected drinks based on the four characters under study: appearance, color, texture, and flavour.

![Index Plot](images/kwt/index.png){#fig-index width="430"}

Additionally, the biplot in @fig-Biplot clearly shows that V4 and V3 are positioned closer to three key characters—Appearance, Texture, and Flavour—indicating that these treatments scored highly for these attributes. If taste alone is the criterion, V2 emerges as the best candidate, as evident from @fig-res1. On the other hand, V1 appears to be the least favourable option, having received low scores across all characters.

![Biplot from PCA](images/kwt/biplot.png){#fig-Biplot}

Combining all this information, the experimenter can arrive at an overall conclusion that is statistically sound and contextually relevant to their study.

RAISINS is equipped with an **AI-powered RAISINS Assistant** designed to assist users in comprehending the outcomes of statistical tests and data analysis. This functionality provides clear and concise summaries of results, identifies statistically significant differences between groups, and offers informed suggestions for potential next steps or interpretations. The AI interpretation given below @fig-ai

RAISINS enables users to draw meaningful conclusions without requiring advanced expertise in statistics.

## Preparing your data {#sec-createData}

What truly matters is the quality of your data! As the saying goes, "garbage in, garbage out" — and this holds true for any software. To prepare your dataset for analysis in RAISINS, you have two options:

1.  Create your dataset in MS Excel\
2.  Build your dataset directly within the RAISINS app

### Preparing data in MS Excel

Open a new blank sheet in MS Excel with only one sheet included, and avoid adding any unnecessary content. The dataset should follow a column-based format, where the first column represents the treatment or group to be compared—you can name this column appropriately, such as "Group" or "Treatment." All characters under study (e.g., Appearance, Texture, Taste) should be arranged in separate columns, and each group should be repeated according to the number of replications. The file can be saved in CSV, XLS, or XLSX format, but CSV is recommended as it is lighter and enables faster loading. Ensure that there are no unwanted spaces in column names or group names. For reference, see the structure shown in @fig-modata1. As illustrated in @fig-raisinkwt, groups must appear repeatedly based on replications, and the data can also be arranged as shown in @fig-modata2.
