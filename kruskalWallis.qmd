# Kruskal Wallis Test {#kwt}

The Kruskal-Wallis test is a **non-parametric** statistical test used to compare the medians of two or more independent groups when the data is not normally distributed or the assumptions of a **one-way ANOVA** are violated. It's essentially a non-parametric equivalent of a one-way ANOVA, but instead of comparing means, it compares medians. It is named after **William Kruskal and W. Allen Wallis**, who developed it in 1952.  

In the Kruskal Wallis test, it is enough for the data to be in the form of ordinal variables, which means values that can be ranked or ordered. This is because the test does not use the actual differences between the values. Unlike ANOVA, which compares group means using real quantitative values and assumes normal distribution and equal variances, the Kruskal Wallis test works by converting all observations into ranks and then checking how these ranks are distributed across the groups. This makes the Kruskal Wallis test suitable for situations where the data are not normally distributed or where the measurements are not precise but can still be ordered in a meaningful way. In the illustration in @fig-anvakwt, you can see ANOVA uses the actual data values, while the Kruskal Wallis test replaces them with their ranks to see if the groups are significantly different.

## Example {#example-scenario}

### Study Context

1.  A food scientist is evaluating four drink flavours (V1 to V4) based on consumer ratings for five sensory attributes: Appearance, Color, Texture, Taste, and Flavour. Each flavour is rated by five judges, giving five replications per group. A separate Kruskal Wallis test can be performed for each sensory attribute to check if there are significant differences in ratings among the flavours.

2.  An agricultural extension researcher is evaluating the effectiveness of four training methods (T1 to T4) based on farmers' knowledge gain. Each method is tested on five farmers, and their knowledge is scored after the training. These scores serve as replications. The Kruskal Wallis test can be used to determine if there is a significant difference in knowledge gain among the four training methods.

3.  An agricultural extension researcher is comparing four different communication approaches (C1 to C4) for delivering farm advisories. Each method is tested on 10 farmers, who rate the clarity of the information received. These clarity scores serve as replications. The Kruskal Wallis test can be applied to determine whether there are significant differences in perceived clarity among the four communication methods.

## Assumptions

The Kruskal-Wallis test relies on the following assumptions:

![](images/kwt/one.png){width="30"} **Non-parametric**: It does not assume a normal distribution of the data, making it suitable for non-normally distributed data

![](images/kwt/two.png){width="30"} **Independence of Observations**: Each sample should be independent of the others, meaning there is no relationship or dependence between the observations within or across group

![](images/kwt/three.png){width="30"} **Ordinal or Continuous Data**: The data should be atleast ordinal, meaning it can be ranked, or continuous.

<details>  

<summary>Key Features of Kruskal-Wallis Test</summary>

-   **Non-parametric**: Unlike ANOVA, it does not assume normality or equal variances, making it suitable for non-normal data.
-   **Extension of the Mann-Whitney U test**: It is essentially an extension of the Mann-Whitney U test, designed for more than two independent samples.
-   **Ranking-based**: Like the Mann-Whitney U test, the Kruskal-Wallis test relies on ranking the data rather than using raw values.
-   **Test statistic**: The test calculates a statistic based on the ranked data to determine if significant differences exist between the groups.

</details>

## Hypotheses

The Kruskal-Wallis test evaluates the following hypotheses:

::: {.callout-note title="Null Hypothesis (H₀)"}
The population medians of all groups are equal.
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)"}
At least one population median is different from the others.
:::  

<details>  

<summary>Steps in Kruskal-Wallis Test</summary>  

 - Step one: Sort and assign ranks to the data

 - Step two: Add up the ranks for each group

 - Step three: Calculate the H statistic

 - Step four: Obtain and interpret the p-value  
 

## The Test Statistic

The Kruskal-Wallis test statistic is calculated as:

::: {.callout-tip title="Use this for Kruskal-Wallis Test"}
$$
\Large H = \frac{12}{N(N+1)} \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{R_i^2}{n_i} - 3(N+1)
$$ {#eq-kwt1}
:::

Where:

-   $N$ is the total number of observations across all groups.
-   $k$ is the number of groups.
-   $n_i$ is the number of observations in group $i$.
-   $R_i$ is the sum of ranks for group $i$.

When there are no ties in the data, $H$ follows a chi-square distribution with $k-1$ degrees of freedom. When ties exist, a correction factor is applied.

## Correction for Ties

If there are tied values in the dataset, the test statistic is adjusted using:

::: {.callout-tip title="Use this for Kruskal-Wallis Test"}
$$
\Large H_{corrected} = \frac{H}{1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{G} (t_i^3 - t_i)}{N^3 - N}}
$$ {#eq-kwt2}
:::

Where:

-   $G$ is the number of groups of tied ranks.
-   $t_i$ is the number of tied values in the $i$-th group.

# Interpreting the Results

After calculating the H statistic:

![](images/kwt/one.png){width="26"} Compare the H value to the critical value from a chi-square distribution with **k-1** degrees of freedom

![](images/kwt/two.png){width="26"} If H exceeds the critical value, reject the null hypothesis

![](images/kwt/three.png){width="25"} Alternatively, compare the p-value to your chosen significance level (typically 0.05)

If you reject the null hypothesis, you can conclude that at least one group is significantly different from the others and proceed for multiple comparison tests.

## Multiple Comparison Test

When the Kruskal-Wallis test is significant, the following post hoc tests are commonly used for pairwise comparisons:

::::: {style="display: flex; gap: 1em;"}
::: dunn-box
**Dunn's Test**\
- Dunn’s Test, developed by Olive Dunn in 1964, is primarily used as a post hoc procedure following the Kruskal-Wallis test.\
- It performs pairwise comparisons while controlling for the **family-wise error rate**.
:::

::: lsd-box
**LSD (Least Significant Difference) Test**\
- Fisher’s LSD test is a parametric post hoc test used after ANOVA to compare all pairwise group differences.\
- It does not correct for multiple comparisons, increasing the false positive rate.
:::
:::::

## P Adjustment Method {#p-adjustment}

In statistical hypothesis testing, p-values indicate the probability of observing results at least as extreme as those observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. When multiple tests are conducted, the risk of false positives (Type I errors) increases. P-value adjustment methods address this issue by controlling the overall error rate, ensuring reliable inference in multiple testing scenarios.

You can select different p-adjustment methods:

-   [Bonferroni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction)
-   [Holm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holm%E2%80%93Bonferroni_method)
-   [Hommel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_testing_correction#Hommel)
-   [Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure (BH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate#Benjamini%E2%80%93Hochberg_procedure)

## Multivariate and AI

The Kruskal-Wallis test is usually used to compare one variable across several groups. It’s a non-parametric test, which means it doesn’t assume the data follows a normal distribution.Now, imagine you have more than one variable (for example, height and weight), and you still want to compare these across different groups. Multivariate analysis in KRUSKAL WALLIS test helps you to compare different characters simultaneously !
