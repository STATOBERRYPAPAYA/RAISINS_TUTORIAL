# Preface {.unnumbered}

For a long time, I have dreamed of writing a book that truly serves the needs of undergraduate students in agriculture—a book that demystifies statistics and makes it accessible and practical for their studies and research. Statistics, while being an essential tool in agricultural sciences, is often presented in ways that make it seem more complicated than it actually is. Textbooks in this field tend to delve into intricate details that go far beyond what most agricultural students require, leaving them overwhelmed and disconnected from the subject's practical relevance.

This book is my humble attempt to change that. It has been written with undergraduate students in mind, focusing on the basics of statistics and their direct applications in agricultural research. Each chapter is designed to simplify complex concepts, making them clear, relatable, and easy to understand. While the primary audience is undergraduate students, this book can also serve as a helpful resource for anyone looking to brush up on the fundamentals of statistics.

The journey of writing this book has been greatly enriched by the feedback and insights of the students at the College of Agriculture, Vellayani. For two years, an earlier version of this book was made available on MeLON (Module for eLearning and Online Notes), our college’s online platform. The students, with their thoughtful suggestions and sharp observations, have helped refine the content and shape it into what it is today. Their enthusiasm and curiosity have been a constant source of inspiration throughout this process.

I would also like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my co-authors, **Dr. Manju Mary Paul**, **Dr. Adarsh V. S.**, and **Mohammed Hisham M.**, whose expertise, commitment, and contributions have been invaluable in bringing this book to life. Their collaboration and dedication have greatly enhanced the quality and depth of this work.

A special thanks to **Jithin Chandran**, **Gaatha Prasad**, **Anjana Biwas T.**, and **Varsha H.** for their valuable suggestions and minor corrections. They were postgraduate students in Agricultural Statistics at the time of writing this book, and their support has significantly increased the quality of this work.

I hope this textbook becomes a guiding light for students and researchers alike, helping them build a solid foundation in statistics while inspiring confidence in their ability to use these tools effectively. If this book makes statistics less intimidating and more approachable for even one reader, I will consider my efforts worthwhile.

With deep gratitude to my students, colleagues, and everyone who supported this work, I present this book as a tool to empower the next generation of agricultural scientists and researchers.
