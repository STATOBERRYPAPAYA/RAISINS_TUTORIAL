# Preface {.unnumbered}  

It is with a heart full of gratitude and hope that I write this preface.

In my years of teaching, guiding, and walking alongside students and researchers in the field of agricultural statistics, I’ve seen firsthand the quiet struggles that go into making sense of data. The frustration of complex software. The confusion over what method to use. The uncertainty that follows even after the analysis is done. I’ve also seen the spark in students’ eyes when they finally “get it”—when the numbers start to make sense and the research starts to come alive.

RAISINS was born out of these moments.

This platform is the result of many years of listening—listening to students who needed simpler tools, to researchers who wanted faster, cleaner analysis, and to colleagues who believed we could build something better. It is also the product of a young, passionate team of statisticians who dreamed big and worked relentlessly to bring that dream to life.

When we created GRAPES, we never imagined it would touch the lives of so many researchers across the world. But with growth came the need for something stronger, more scalable, and more inclusive. That led to the founding of STATOBERRY LLP—and the creation of RAISINS, a platform that simplifies powerful statistical analysis for everyone, regardless of coding ability.

This handbook is our humble attempt to walk with you—not as experts talking down from a pedestal, but as fellow researchers, educators, and learners who understand the challenges of this path. It is written with care, not just to show you how to use RAISINS, but to help you understand the ‘why’ behind the tools. Because statistics, at its heart, is about making sense of the data.

To the students: I’ve seen your struggle with analysis, your nervous presentations, and your quiet victories. This book is for you.  

To the researchers: I know the pressure you carry and the passion that drives you. This book is for you too.  

To the teachers, guides, and mentors: Thank you for shaping curious minds. This book is also yours.

Let this be a shared space—a living, growing resource that evolves with every suggestion you send, every idea you offer, and every module we add. May it make your research a little easier, your understanding a little clearer, and your confidence a little stronger.

With warmth and solidarity,
